Experimental realization of Counterfactual Quantum Cryptography,"In counterfactual QKD information is transfered, in a secure way, between
Alice and Bob even when no particle carrying the information is in fact
transmitted between them. In this letter we fully implement the scheme for
counterfactual QKD proposed in [T. Noh, \PRL \textbf{103}, 230501 (2009)],
demonstrating for the first time that information can be transmitted between
two parties without the transmission of a carrier.","['Giorgio Brida', 'Andrea Cavanna', 'Ivo Pietro Degiovanni', 'Marco Genovese', 'Paolo Traina']",[],0,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5467v1,False,True,False,False,False,3069,James Traina,Berkeley,Active,2024,,"This project delves into the intricate dynamics of distortions and their impact on productivity measurement across diverse sectors, including manufacturing, trade, and services. Leveraging the granularity of restricted-use microdata, this study employs a novel micro-econometric approach to uncover productions functions, productivity estimates, and distortions. The central hypothesis of the research is that distortions significantly influence productivity measurements, with these influences varying across sectors due to the specific types of distortions prevalent in each market. Additionally, this study posits several secondary hypotheses for testing: distortions may be larger in service sectors compared to manufacturing and trade sectors; less capital-intensive industries may exhibit different manifestations and sensitivities to distortions; and the impact of distortions on productivity may be moderated by firm-specific factors such as size, age, and management practices. The final analysis will provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between distortions and productivity. The findings are expected to contribute to the broader discourse on productivity measurement and distortions, improving Census estimates of sectoral productivity."
