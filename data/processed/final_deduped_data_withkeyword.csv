"Globalization, Technology, and the Skill Premium: A Quantitative Analysis",2010,[],Ariel Burstein; Jonathan Vogel,Ariel Burstein; Jonathan Vogel,https://doi.org/10.3386/w16459,"We construct a model of international trade and multinational production (MP) to examine the impact of globalization on the skill premium in skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.The key mechanisms in our framework arise from the interaction between three elements: cross-country differences in factor endowments and sectoral productivities, technological heterogeneity across producers within sectors, and skill-biased technology.Reductions in trade and/or MP costs induce a reallocation of resources towards a country's comparative advantage sector (increasing the skill premium in skill-abundant countries and reducing it in skill-scarce countries) and within sectors towards more productive and skill-intensive producers (increasing the skill premium in all countries).We parameterize the model to match salient features of the extent and composition of trade and MP between the U.S. and skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries in 2006.We show that a reduction in trade and MP costs, moving from autarky to 2006 levels of trade and MP, increases the skill premium by roughly 5% in skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.We also show that the growth in US trade and MP between 1966 and 2006 accounts for 1/9th of the 24% rise in the US skill premium over this period.MP is at least as important as international trade in generating this rise in the skill premium.","National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; University of California, Los Angeles","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Bunche Hall 8365 Box 951477 UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477; Department of Economics Columbia University 420 West 118th Street New York, NY 10027","Department of Economics Bunche Hall 8365 Box 951477 UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Columbia University 420 West 118th Street New York, NY 10027","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Globalization, Economics, Business, Econometrics, Market economy"
Tariff effects on MNC decisions to engage in intra‐firm and arm's‐length trade,2009,[],Susan Feinberg; Michael P. Keane,Susan E. Feinberg; Michael P. Keane,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5982.2009.01532.x,"Abstract Using confidential firm‐level data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on activities of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) and their Canadian affiliates, we study the dramatic growth of intra‐firm and arm's‐length U.S.‐Canada trade over the 1984–95 period. We find that decisions to engage in intra‐firm and arm's‐length trade are essentially unrelated to tariff and transport cost reductions over this sample period. Thus, we find that the increase in trade occurred almost entirely on the intensive rather than the extensive margin. This is consistent with case study evidence in Keane and Feinberg (2006), where MNC executives consistently indicate that the modest tariff reductions of the 1984–95 period were not sufficient to justify fixed costs of overhauling international supply chains. Our results have important implications for recent influential models of international trade that rely on sensitivity of intra‐firm trade to tariffs at the extensive margin to explain how small tariff declines could have led to the explosion of intra‐firm trade since the 1980s. We also find that initial conditions (i.e., 1983 tariffs) are uncorrelated with whether firms engaged in intra‐firm or arm's‐length trade activity at the start of the sample period. This result is surprising as it implies that firms/industries with a greater propensity to engage in trade were not, in general, successful at lobbying for more favourable tariff treatment.","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; University of Technology Sydney","Rutgers, University; ARC Federation Fellow, University of Technology Sydney","Rutgers, University; ARC Federation Fellow, University of Technology Sydney","bea, nber, bureau","Tariff, Multinational corporation, Margin (machine learning), International economics, International trade, Economics, Sample (material), Business, Finance, Chemistry, Chromatography, Machine learning, Computer science"

Innovation may play a more important role in the decision to start exporting, and successful exporting may drive process innovation. This suggests that the causality between innovation and exporting may run in both directions. Using detailed microdata from innovation surveys, industrial production surveys, and trade information for Slovenian firms in 1996–2002, we investigate the bidirectional causal relationship between firm innovation and export activity. We find no evidence for the hypothesis that either product or process innovations increase the probability of becoming a first‐time exporter, but we do find evidence in both the innovation survey and the industrial production survey that exporting leads to productivity improvements. These, however, are likely to be related to process rather than product innovations, and are observed only in a sample of medium and large first‐time exporters. This finding makes a case in favour of the learning‐by‐exporting hypothesis by demonstrating that these learning effects from exporting occur through the mechanism of process innovation enhancing firm technical efficiency.",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,University of Ljubljana and KU Leuven; University of Ljubljana,University of Ljubljana and KU Leuven; University of Ljubljana,"irs, microdata","Microdata (statistics), Product innovation, Productivity, Economics, Production (economics), Industrial organization, Product (mathematics), Sample (material), Causality (physics), Process (computing), Business, Microeconomics, Computer science, Macroeconomics, Operating system, Population, Chemistry, Physics, Demography, Geometry, Mathematics, Chromatography, Quantum mechanics, Sociology, Census"

In our model, market size and trade affect the toughness of competition, which then feeds back into the selection of heterogeneous producers and exporters in that market. Aggregate productivity and average mark-ups thus respond to both the size of a market and the extent of its integration through trade (larger, more integrated markets exhibit higher productivity and lower mark-ups). Our model remains highly tractable, even when extended to a general framework with multiple asymmetric countries integrated to different extents through asymmetric trade costs.

Productivity differences explain much of the variation in incomes across countries, and technology plays a key role in determining productivity. The pattern of worldwide technical change is determined largely by international technology diffusion because a few rich countries account for most of the world's creation of new technology. Cross-country income convergence turns on whether technology diffusion is global or local. There is no indication that international diffusion is inevitable or automatic, but rather, domestic technology investments are necessary. Better understanding of what determines the effectiveness of technology diffusion sheds light on the pace at which the world's technology frontier may expand.",Center for Economic and Policy Research,"University of Texas, Austin; NBER and CEPR.","University of Texas, Austin; NBER and CEPR.","nber, cepr","Pace, Productivity, Frontier, Diffusion, Convergence (economics), Economics, Economic geography, International trade, Technological change, Diffusion of innovations, Regional science, Business, Industrial organization, Development economics, Economic growth, Macroeconomics, Marketing, Geography, Physics, Archaeology, Geodesy, Thermodynamics"

We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size.

A consensus in the development literature is that differences in productivity are a dominant source of these differences. But what accounts for productivity differences across countries? One explanation is that frontier technologies and best practice methods are slow to diffuse to low-income countries. The recent literature on misallocation offers a distinct but complementary explanation: low-income countries are not as effective in allocating their factors of production to their most efficient use. We provide our perspective on three key questions. First, how important is misallocation? Second, what are the causes of misallocation? And third, beyond the direct cost of lower contemporaneous output, are there additional costs associated with misallocation? A summary of our answers is as follows: Misallocation appears to be a substantial channel in accounting for productivity differences across countries, but the measured magnitude of the effects depends on the approach and context. Researchers have not yet found a dominant source of misallocation; instead, many specific factors seem to contribute a small part of the overall effect. Beyond the static cost of misallocation, we believe that the dynamic effects of misallocation on productivity growth are significant and deserve much more attention going forward.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; University of Toronto,"Diego Restuccia is a Professor of Economics and a Canada Research Chair, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Richard Rogerson is the Charles and Marie Robertson Professor of Public and International Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Diego Restuccia is a Professor of Economics and a Canada Research Chair, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Richard Rogerson is the Charles and Marie Robertson Professor of Public and International Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","irs, national bureau of economic research, bureau","Productivity, Economics, Context (archaeology), Production (economics), Frontier, Perspective (graphical), Macroeconomics, History, Archaeology, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Paleontology, Biology"

The productivity growth has been relatively stronger in those countries and sectors that relied more on competitive devaluations to regain price competitiveness before the euro was adopted. This finding is confirmed by an analysis of firm-level data from the Italian manufacturing sector. This study finds that low-tech businesses, which arguably benefited most from devaluations, have been restructuring more since the adoption of the euro.

To help address the implications of this growth for developed economies, this paper gauges the relative sophistication of Chinese exports along two dimensions. First, I measure China's export overlap with developed countries by comparing the set of products China exports to the United States with the bundle of products exported by the OECD. Second, I compare Chinese and other countries' exports within product markets in terms of the price they receive in the US market. While China's export overlap with the OECD is much greater than one would predict given its low wages, the prices that US consumers are willing to pay for China's exports are substantially lower than the prices they are willing to pay for OECD exports. This fact, as well as the increase in the 'OECD premium' over time, suggests that competition between China and the world's most developed economies may be less direct than their product-mix overlap implies. It may also reflect efforts by developed-country firms to compete with China by dropping their least sophisticated offerings and moving up the quality ladder. — Peter K.

When the firm size distribution follows a power law with an exponent close to minus one, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms have an impact on aggregate volatility. Smaller countries have fewer firms and, thus, higher volatility. Trade opening makes the large firms more important, thus raising macroeconomic volatility.

Are they really mighty giants when it comes to their impact on manufacturing employment? The authors attempt to answer this question by estimating the effects of trade with China and India on Argentina's industrial employment. They use a dynamic econometric model and industry level data to estimate the effects of trade with China and India on the level of employment in Argentina's manufacturing sector. Results suggest that trade with China and India only had a small negative effect on industrial employment, even during the swift trade liberalization of the 1990s.

Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.","University of Zurich; University of California, San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; United States Social Security Administration; Massachusetts Institute of Technology","[University of Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland]; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, United States; Social Security Administration, Baltimore, United States; University of California, San Diego, San Diego, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research","[University of Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland]; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, United States; Social Security Administration, Baltimore, United States; University of California, San Diego, San Diego, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Earnings, Labour economics, Shock (circulatory), Manufacturing, Competition (biology), Wage, Economics, Manufacturing sector, Business, Demographic economics, Medicine, Ecology, Accounting, Marketing, Internal medicine, Biology"

These results are stronger for destinations with higher trade costs and not driven by firm size or other sector characteristics.

The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields,1983,[],Paul DiMaggio; Walter W. Powell,Paul J. DiMaggio; Walter W. Powell,https://doi.org/10.2307/2095101,"Instead of examining why organizations are dissimilar, this study explores why organizations tend to be increasingly and inevitably homogenous in their forms and practices. Organizations in a similar line of work are structured into an organizational field by powerful forces that lead them to become similar. Rather than the causes of rationalization and bureaucratization suggested by Max Weber, including competition and the need for efficiency, institutional similarity is due to the structuration of organizational fields, a process caused largely by the state and the professions, which are the great rationalizers of the late 20th century. In highly structured organizational fields, rational efforts of individuals aggregately lead to structural, cultural, and output homogeneity. Homogenization is best captured by the concept of isomorphism, the process whereby one element in a population resembles others that confront the same environmental conditions. The two types of isomorphism are competitive and institutional. Three processes lead to organizational similarity: (1) coercive isomorphism stemming from political influence and the problem of legitimacy; (2) mimetic isomorphism resulting from uniform responses to uncertainty; and (3) normative isomorphism associated with professionalism. While these isomorphic processes improve organizational transactions, they do not necessarily increase internal efficiency. Twelve hypotheses are offered for further research about which organizational fields will be most homogenous. These hypotheses relate the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalism and structuration on isomorphic change.

IntroductionMacroeconomic models of fluctuations in hours of work over the business cycle or across countries imply much larger labor supply elasticities than microeconometric estimates of hours elasticities. Understanding this divergence is critical for questions ranging from the sources of business cycles to the impacts of tax policy on growth and inequality. Starting with the seminal work of Rogerson (1988) and Hansen (1985), one leading explanation of the divergence is the extensive margin response created by indivisible labor supply. If labor supply is indivisible, changes in tax or wage rates can generate large changes in aggregate hours by inducing extensive margin (participation) responses even if they have little effect on hours conditional on employment. In view of this argument, modern macro models are calibrated to match low micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities. However, the extensive margin elasticity is usually treated as a free parameter that can be calibrated purely to match macroeconomic moments.We argue that the extensive margin elasticity should not be treated as a free parameter. Macro models should be calibrated to match micro estimates of extensive margin elasticities in the same way that they are calibrated to match micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities. The size of the extensive margin responses depends on the density of the distribution of reservation wages around the economy's equilibrium. The same marginal density that determines the impacts of macroeconomic variation on aggregate employment also determines the impacts of quasi-experiments such as tax policy changes on employment rates. Micro estimates of extensive margin elasticities can therefore be used to calibrate macro models.1In this paper, we assess whether existing calibrations of macro models are consistent with micro evidence on extensive margin responses. In doing so, we find that it is crucial to distinguish between two types of elasticities: Hicksian and Frisch. The Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity controls intertemporal substitution responses to temporary wage fluctuations and is therefore the relevant parameter for understanding labor supply fluctuations over the business cycle.2 The Hicksian (wealth constant) elasticity controls steady-state responses to permanent wage changes and is therefore the relevant parameter for understanding differences in labor supply across countries with different tax systems. We use two approaches to comparing macro calibrations with micro evidence: simulations of quasi-experiments and a meta-analysis of micro elasticity estimates. Both approaches show that micro and macro evidence agree about Hicksian (steady state) elasticities but disagree about Frisch (intertemporal substitution) elasticities.We begin by simulating the impacts of policy changes that generate exogenous changes in incentives to work in a standard macro model and comparing the predicted responses with the findings of microeconometric studies. We use Rogerson and Wallenius's (2009, henceforth, RW) calibrated model of life cycle labor supply as a benchmark model for this exercise. The RW model matches macro evidence by generating an intertemporal substitution elasticity of aggregate hours above 2 even when calibrated to generate a Frisch intensive-margin elasticity below 0.5. We simulate labor supply responses to three policies using this model: (1) a tax-free year in Iceland in 1987 studied by Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega (2001); (2) a randomized experiment providing temporary subsidies for work to welfare recipients in Canada (Card and Hyslop 2005); and (3) the 1994 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-income individuals in the United States (Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001). The first two examples are ideal for identifying Frisch elasticities because they induce temporary variation in wage rates. Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega (2001) find that employment rates in Iceland do indeed rise in 1987, but the increase is only one-fifth as large as that predicted by the RW model. Similarly, the calibrated RW model predicts intertemporal substitution responses to the work subsidies in Canada that are nearly four times larger than what Card and Hyslop observe in their data. The third example—the EITC expansion—generates permanent variation in tax rates and thus is well-suited for identifying steady-state elasticities. The RW model performs better in matching the impacts of the EITC expansion on employment rates because it generates a Hicksian aggregate hours elasticity of approximately 0.7, resulting in steady-state impacts of taxes on labor supply that are closer to micro estimates.While our quantitative results rest on the particular assumptions of the RW model, our qualitative conclusions apply more generally. Any macro model that relies primarily on changes in labor supply to generate business cycle fluctuations must feature a large extensive margin Frisch elasticity. As a result, any such model will overpredict the response to temporary wage changes such as the tax holiday in Iceland and work subsidies in Canada. Intuitively, fluctuations in employment over the business cycle and the employment effects of quasi-experimental wage changes are both fundamentally determined by the same density of the reservation wage distribution at the margin irrespective of model specification. Thus, any labor supply model that fits the quasi-experimental evidence cannot generate large fluctuations in employment over the business cycle.To explore whether the results of the three studies we consider in the simulations are representative of the broader empirical literature, we conduct a meta-analysis of quasi-experimental estimates of extensive margin elasticities. We summarize results from fifteen studies that span a broad range of countries, demographic groups, time periods, and sources of variation. These studies generally analyze changes in incentives for small subgroups of the population, permitting identification of labor supply elasticities that are not confounded by changes in equilibrium wage rates. Despite the great variation in methodologies, there is consensus about extensive margin elasticities. The mean extensive margin elasticity among the studies we consider is 0.28 and every estimate is below 0.43. The intertemporal substitution (Frisch) elasticity estimates for temporary policy changes turn out be quite similar to the steady-state elasticity estimates obtained from permanent policy changes. The small elasticities imply that most individuals are at a corner in their employment choices; that is, the density of individuals at the margin of employment is thin in practice.We conclude our analysis by evaluating whether extensive margin elasticities of around 0.25 as suggested by micro evidence are adequate to reconcile the gap between micro and macro estimates of aggregate hours elasticities. To do so, we summarize micro and macro estimates of Hicksian and Frisch elasticities on both the extensive and intensive margins. We find that micro and macro studies agree about the steady-state impacts of taxes on labor supply. Both micro and macro studies imply Hicksian extensive margin elasticities around 0.2. And both micro and macro evidence are consistent with intensive margin elasticities around 0.3 once one accounts for frictions that may attenuate observed micro estimates (Chetty, Friedman, et al. 2011; Chetty 2012). Prescott's (2004) widely-cited cross-country data set implies an aggregate hours (extensive plus intensive) Hicksian elasticity of 0.7, only slightly larger than micro estimates.3 These findings indicate that labor supply responses to taxation could indeed explain much of the variation in hours of work across countries with different tax systems.4On the intertemporal substitution margin, the limited existing evidence on intensive margin elasticities suggests that values around 0.5 are consistent with both micro and macro data. However, micro and macro estimates of extensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticities differ by an order of magnitude. Quasi-experimental estimates of extensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticities are around 0.25. In contrast, pure equilibrium macro models, in which employment fluctuations are driven purely by preferences, imply intertemporal substitution extensive margin elasticities in excess of 2. Hence, the puzzle to be resolved is why employment rates fluctuate so much over the business cycle relative to what one would predict based on the impacts of tax changes on employment rates—that is, why micro and macro estimates of the Frisch extensive margin elasticity are so different.5 Even accounting for indivisible labor, micro studies do not support representative-agent macro models that generate Frisch elasticities above 1.There are two potential concerns that one may have with using microeconomic estimates to calibrate macroeconomic models. The first is that heterogeneity in extensive margin responses complicates the mapping from micro estimates to macro elasticities that reflect economy-wide behavior.6 This problem is compounded by the concern that micro studies sometimes exclude important subgroups that could matter for economy-wide extensive margin responses (Dyrda, Kaplan, and Ríos-Rull 2012). In practice, however, heterogeneity across subgroups appears to strengthen our main conclusion about agreement on the Hicksian elasticity but disagreement on the Frisch elasticity. The heterogeneity in micro estimates of extensive-margin Hicksian elasticities mirrors the heterogeneity observed in macro studies of steady-state responses. For instance, both micro and macro studies indicate that extensive-margin elasticities are higher for subgroups that are less attached to the labor force, such as single mothers and individuals near retirement. However, heterogeneity magnifies the discrepancy between micro and macro estimates of intertemporal substitution elasticities. Most notably, employment rates fluctuate substantially over the business cycle even for prime-age males, which stands in sharp contrast with the near-zero micro extensive margin Frisch elasticity estimates for this group.A second potential concern in mapping micro estimates to macro labor supply elasticities is that reduced-form micro studies may not directly identify the structural primitives of the reservation wage distribution that control extensive margin labor supply choices. This is particularly a concern if frictions prevent the labor market from clearing, as our analysis suggests. In a model with frictions, reduced-form micro elasticity estimates represent a convolution of the density of the reservation wage distribution at the margin and other structural parameters, such as the distribution of adjustment costs or search frictions or the degree of liquidity constraints. Importantly, the same reduced-form elasticities would also determine the impact of wage changes on labor supply over the business cycle in such an environment. Hence, micro estimates should continue to provide useful targets for calibrating macro models even though they do not identify the structure of preferences or other primitives necessary for normative analysis.7 However, especially when reduced-form elasticities combine several structural parameters, they may not be stable across settings. Because of this instability, one should not seek to calibrate macro models to match any single estimate of a micro elasticity. Nevertheless, one can gauge the range of plausible magnitudes by pooling evidence from many different studies and settings as we do here. The fact that every quasi-experimental study we review finds elasticities significantly less than 0.5 casts doubt upon macro models calibrated with extensive margin elasticities above 1.The article is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the existing literature on indivisible labor. In section III, we establish a terminology for the various elasticity concepts, as these terms are often used in different ways in the existing literature. Section IV reports simulations of the three quasi-experiments in the Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model. Section V presents the meta-analysis of micro estimates. In section VI, we compare micro and macro evidence on the intensive and extensive margins. Section VII concludes. Details of the simulation methods and meta-analysis are given in the appendix.II. Indivisible Labor: BackgroundEquilibrium macroeconomic models—in which differences in hours of work are driven by preferences—require large labor supply elasticities to explain the variation in hours of work over the business cycle and across countries with different tax regimes. In contrast, quasi-experimental microeconometric studies of the impacts of tax reforms on hours of work and earnings typically obtain elasticities close to zero for most groups except very high income earners.8A large literature has posited that the discrepancy between micro and macro elasticities can be explained by indivisibilities in labor (e.g., Hansen 1985; Rogerson 1988; Cho and Rogerson 1988; Christiano and Eichenbaum 1992; Cho and Cooley 1994; King and Rebelo 1999; Chang and Kim 2006; Ljungqvist and Sargent 2006; Prescott, Rogerson, and Wallenius 2009; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009).9 If individuals cannot freely choose hours of work or face fixed costs of entry, aggregate employment depends upon the distribution of reservation wages in the economy. If this distribution has substantial density at the margin—that is, many individuals are indifferent between working and not working at prevailing wage rates—then a small reduction in wage rates could reduce aggregate hours of work significantly because many individuals will stop working. Yet the same change in wage rates may not affect hours of work conditional on employment very much, implying a small intensive margin labor supply elasticity. As a result, a model with large extensive margin elasticities and small intensive margin elasticities could match both the micro and macro evidence. Motivated by these results, modern macro models are calibrated to match micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities but typically calibrate the extensive margin elasticity purely to match macroeconomic moments (King and Rebelo 1999; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009; Ljungqvist and Sargent 2011).In parallel with the development of macro models of indivisible labor supply, a large microeconometric literature has recognized the importance of the extensive margin in the analysis of labor supply. Ashenfelter (1984) and Heckman (1984) discuss the importance of extensive margin labor supply choices in the analysis of aggregate fluctuations. Heckman and Killingsworth (1986) and Heckman (1993) review the literature on labor supply models that explicitly model participation decisions. More recent research has estimated extensive margin elasticities using quasi-experimental methods.However, macro models have not been calibrated to match micro evidence on extensive margin elasticities. One complication in performing such a calibration is that extensive margin elasticities vary with the wage rate unless the density of the reservation wage distribution happens to be uniform. Hence, any micro estimate of an extensive margin elasticity is necessarily local to the wage variation used for identification. However, this argument does not justify treating the extensive margin elasticity as a free parameter for two reasons. First, if the micro estimates are identified using variation similar to that used in macroeconomic comparisons, one will obtain the appropriate local elasticity relevant for macro calibrations. Second, the same problem arises when calibrating macro models with micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities, insofar as elasticities will only be constant on the intensive margin if utility happens to produce a constant-elasticity labor supply function. We revisit this issue in section VI and show that, if anything, observable heterogeneity in elasticities reinforces the conclusions drawn later.III. TerminologyIt is helpful to establish some conventions about terminology given the various elasticity concepts discussed in this paper. We distinguish between elasticities based on the margin of response (extensive vs. intensive) and the timing of response (intertemporal substitution vs. steady state). There are four elasticities of interest: steady-state extensive, steady-state intensive, intertemporal extensive, and intertemporal intensive. Each of these four elasticities can be estimated using both micro (quasi-experimental) and macroeconomic variation. We use the terms ""micro"" and ""macro"" elasticities exclusively to refer to the source of variation used to estimate the elasticity. The elasticity of aggregate hours—the relevant parameter for calibrating a representative agent model—is the sum of the extensive and intensive margin elasticities, weighted by hours of work if individuals have heterogeneous preferences (Blundell, Bozio, and Laroque 2011).The macro literature uses the term ""macro elasticity"" to refer to the Frisch elasticity of aggregate hours and ""micro elasticity"" to refer to the intensive-margin elasticity of hours conditional on employment (e.g., Prescott 2004; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009). We use different terminology here for two reasons. First, the intensive-margin is no more ""micro"" than the extensive margin; both are determined by household-level choices and both have been estimated using micro data. Second, and more importantly, the Frisch elasticity is critical for understanding business cycle fluctuations in models where aggregate hours fluctuations are purely driven by labor supply, but it is not the relevant parameter for evaluating the steady-state impacts of differences in taxes across countries. The Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity controls intertemporal substitution responses to temporary wage fluctuations, while the Hicksian (wealth constant) elasticity controls steady-state responses and the welfare consequences of taxation (MaCurdy 1981; Auerbach 1985).10The distinction between Hicksian and Frisch elasticities is quite important in practice. Prescott (2004) reports that cross-country differences in aggregate hours imply an elasticity of 3 in a representative-agent model, whereas Davis and Henrekson (2005) estimate an elasticity of 0.33 using similar data. The difference arises primarily because Prescott reports a Frisch elasticity whereas Davis and Henrekson report a Hicksian elasticity. Regressing log hours on log tax rates in Prescott's data yields a Hicksian elasticity of 0.7, as shown in figure 2, panel A. Prescott maps this estimate of the Hicksian elasticity into a value for a Frisch elasticity based on parametric assumptions about utility and the wealth-earnings ratio. When utility is time-separable, the Frisch (εF) and Hicksian (εH) elasticities are related by the following identity (Ziliak and Kniesner 1999; Browning 2005):where ρ is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), (d[wl])/dA is the marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income, and A/wl is the ratio of assets to earnings. The reason that Prescott obtains a much larger value of εF than εH is that the parametric utility specification he uses produces large values of A/wl and (d[wl])/dA. However, microeconometric evidence shows that income effects on labor supply are much smaller than those produced by the Prescott utility specification (Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen 1993; Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote 2001). Under a utility specification that matches empirical estimates of the mean values of (d[wl])/dA and A/wl, the Frisch elasticity is only slightly larger than the Hicksian elasticity because the difference between the two elasticities is proportional to the income effect squared (d[wl]/dA)2 (Chetty 2012, table III).11IV. Simulations of Quasi-Experiments in the RW ModelWe evaluate whether macro models with indivisible labor are consistent with micro evidence on extensive margin responses by focusing on the Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model. The RW model is a leading example of recent models of indivisible labor that aggregate over individuals by time-averaging over the life cycle, as in Ljungqvist and Sargent (2006). The model is well-suited for our purposes because it features both an extensive and intensive margin of labor supply. Rogerson and Wallenius calibrate their model to show that small intensive- margin micro elasticities are consistent with a large Frisch elasticity of aggregate hours. We adopt the parameters chosen by RW and simulate the impacts of policy changes analyzed in three prominent microeconometric studies.12Setup. RW analyze an overlapping-generations model in which a unit mass of agents is born at each instant and lives for one unit of time. An individual who supplies h(a) ∈ [0, 1] hours at age a produces efficiency units of labor, whereis a tent-shaped life cycle productivity profile and . Complete asset markets lead to perfect consumption smoothing. With log utility over consumption, each generation solveswhere τ is the tax rate and T is a lump-sum tax rebate that balances the government's budget. The model can be solved analytically as described in RW and in the technical appendix. Because wages are paid per efficiency unit, individuals have low hourly wage rates at the beginning and end of their lives and find it optimal not to work at those points. This generates an extensive margin of participation over the life cycle. The convex disutility over hours of work generates an intensive margin hours response to changes in wage rates as well. Rogerson and Wallenius normalize the price of output to 1 and assume a constant- returns-to-scale production technology, so changes in tax rates have no impact on pretax wages and prices. Accordingly, the quasi-experiments we simulate also hold pretax wages and prices constant, as the studies on which they are based typically analyze the impacts of differential changes in incentives for relatively small subgroups of the population.Rogerson and Wallenius calibrate the parameters α, e1, and to match empirically observed values for the fraction of life worked (f), the maximum hours worked per week over the life cycle (hmax), and the wage rate at retirement relative to the maximum wage rate over the life cycle (wR/wmax). Following RW, we set hmax = 45% (45 hours per week) and wR/ wmax = 1/2. We set f to match the aggregate employment rate in the period prior to each policy experiment we consider. The parameter controls the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, as in standard life cycle models (Card 1990). We set γ = 2 to obtain an intensive margin Frisch elasticity of εINT = 1/γ = 0.5, consistent with the microeconometric evidence summarized in the following; we show in appendix A that setting εINT = 0.25 yields similar results.13 For each of the three tax policy changes simulated in the following, we choose the model's remaining parameters {α, e1, } to match the moments {hmax, wR/wmax, f } under the tax system prior to the tax change.14 In all three cases, the calibrated model generates an intertemporal substitution elasticity for aggregate hours above 2 despite having an intensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticity of only 0.5, consistent with RW's main result.15 As in RW, we assume that each agent lives for sixty years (corresponding to average adult working lives) and simulate each quasi-experiment by changing the tax rate for the number of periods in the model that correspond to the duration of the tax policy change in the data.16To simulate the impacts of unanticipated tax changes, we must specify how the lump sum rebate T changes for each agent. To simplify aggregation, we assume that each generation receives a lump-sum rebate equal to the taxes they pay at each instant in time.17 We ignore heterogeneity in the tax system across individuals and set τ equal to the average tax rate for the subgroup analyzed (which is relevant for extensive margin decisions).Experiment 1: Tax holiday in Iceland. In 1987, Iceland suspended its income tax for one year as it transitioned from a system under which taxes were paid on the previous year's income to a system where taxes were paid on current earnings. In 1987, individuals paid tax on income earned in 1986; in 1988, individuals were taxed on income earned in 1988, and thus income in 1987 was untaxed. The average tax rate was 14.5 percent in 1986, 0 in 1987, and 8.0 percent in 1988 (Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega 2001). Although this tax change could also produce a change in labor demand due to a general equilibrium impact on wage rates, the tax holiday had no impact on labor supply for individuals with low initial tax rates (Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega 2001, figure 9). This implies that the general equilibrium feedback on wage rates was negligible, so the aggregate employment response can be interpreted as a labor supply elasticity.18 We simulate the tax reform in Iceland in the RW model under the assumption that the tax system remains stable prior to 1986 and after 1988. The reform was announced in late 1986, so we model the tax change as an unanticipated change at the start of 1987. The average employment rate in the three-year period prior to the reform is f = 79.2%, which implies that individuals work for 47.5 years in the model. The single-year tax reduction thus comes close to the ideal experiment for identifying a Frisch elasticity of reducing tax rates for an infinitesimal fraction of the working life.Panel A of figure 1 plots annual changes in employment rates (the employment rate in year t minus the employment rate in year t – 1) around the reform, demarcated by the vertical line. The Icelandic administrative records analyzed by Bianchi and colleagues (squares) show a modest but significant increase in employment rates in 1987 followed by a sharp dip in 1988, consistent with intertemporal substitution. The impact predicted by the RW model (circles) is an order of magnitude larger than the observed impact. In the data, employment is 3 percentage points higher in 1987 relative to 1988, but the RW model predicts that it would be 13.5 percentage points higher. The model generates a much larger spike in employment because the fraction of cohorts that are close to being indifferent between working and staying out of the labor force is large. The temporary increase in the wage rates therefore induces a large group of agents to work. Note that it is precisely this mechanism—having a large fraction of individuals near the margin—that allows the RW model to generate a large Frisch elasticity for aggregate hours and thus explain fluctuations in aggregate hours over the business cycle.Fig. 1. Impacts of tax changes on employment rates: Simulations versus dataNotes: Each panel shows the impact of an unanticipated change in incentives to work on employment rates. The dashed series shows the impact predicted by the calibrated Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model, while the solid series shows the impact observed in the data. Panel A: Iceland suspended its income tax for one year in 1987. Average tax rates in Iceland changed from 14.5 percent in 1986 to 0 percent in 1987 and then 8.0 percent in 1988. Following Bianchi, Gudmunsson, and Zoega (2001), we define the employment rate as the fraction of weeks worked in a given year in the adult population. This panel plots annual changes in employment rates. Panel B: The Canadian SSP demonstration randomly assigned a group of welfare recipients a wage subsidy for thirty-six months in the early 1990s. Individuals in the control group faced an effective average tax rate of 74.3 percent for working full time at the minimum wage, while individuals in the treatment group faced an effective average tax rate of 16.7 percent. Following Card and Hyslop (2005), we plot the difference in monthly employment rates between the treatment and control groups. We add the observed control group mean at the start of the experiment (23.5 percent) to the difference for scaling purposes. Simulated employment rates are the fraction of individuals aged sixteen to forty-six working in a given month, reflecting the age distribution of the SSP treatment group (see appendix A). Panel C: The EITC expansion in the United States in 1994 and 1995 lowered average tax rates net of taxes and transfers for single mothers from 50.8 percent in 1992 to 43.6 percent in 1996. Meyer (2010, figure 2) reports annual employment rates for single women using CPS data. We plot the employment rates of single mothers adjusted for observables and time trends as in Meyer (2010); simulated employment rates are reported for individuals aged sixteen to forty-six.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointExperiment 2: SSP welfare demonstration in Canada.

We include individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The progressivity of the U.S. federal tax system at the top of the income distribution has declined dramatically since the 1960s. This dramatic drop in progressivity is due primarily to a drop in corporate taxes and in estate and gift taxes combined with a sharp change in the composition of top incomes away from capital income and toward labor income. The sharp drop in statutory top marginal individual income tax rates has contributed only moderately to the decline in tax progressivity. International comparisons confirm that is it critical to take into account other taxes than the individual income tax to properly assess the extent of overall tax progressivity, both for time trends and for cross-country comparisons. The pattern for the United Kingdom is similar to the U.S. pattern. France had less progressive taxes than the United States or the United Kingdom in 1970 but has experienced an increase in tax progressivity and has now a more progressive tax system than the United States or the United Kingdom.","National Bureau of Economic Research; Paris School of Economics; University of California, Berkeley; Centre for Economic Policy Research","Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Professor of Economics, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Paris, France, and a Research Fellow, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London, United Kingdom.","Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Professor of Economics, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Paris, France, and a Research Fellow, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London, United Kingdom.","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Economics, Gross income, State income tax, Income tax, Value-added tax, Indirect tax, Progressive tax, Tax reform, Labour economics, Tax deferral, Direct tax, Ad valorem tax, International taxation, Adjusted gross income, Public economics"

First, we find that pension systems are designed to be progressive by granting a higher replacement rate to low-income workers than high-income workers. However, because all systems subsidize pensions beyond what an actuarially fair system would produce, the absolute subsidies are larger for high-income individuals. Second, using data from Colombia, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay, we show that, in practice, pension systems tend to be regressive rather than progressive. This is because low-income workers, who contribute intermittently, typically receive no pension as they fail to meet the minimum contribution levels. In some defined benefit systems, 70–95% of subsidies are concentrated in the top three labor income deciles. In defined contribution systems, subsidies are less regressive, but 50–60% still concentrate on high-income deciles.

The extent of redistribution depends on how both the accumulation phase and the payout phase are designed. The demographic groups with lower average life expectancies will fare poorly under an annuity rule that dictates the employment of a single annuity conversion factor, or a single price, for all individuals of the same age. Setting a higher assumed interest rate will lead in less redistribution from high mortality rate groups to lower mortality groups. Any pricing scheme that tries to consider mortality heterogeneity by pricing based on group characteristics will make some individuals even worse off.

This reform plan is designed to preserve the core objectives of the current Social Security system and, at the same time, gain the benefits of personal accounts. In recent years, the United States has been engaged in a heated debate about whether to replace part of the current, defined benefit (DB) Social Security system with a system of defined contribution (DC) personal accounts. In the current system, the benefits received by Social Security contributors are based on a concave function of lifetime earnings, providing smaller increments in benefits with each additional dollar of lifetime earnings. The importance of making the Social Security system self-balancing by incorporating a market-based aggregate self-correction mechanism is emphasized. The resulting estimates of the ""maximum transition cost"" measure of system obligations are significantly lower than those of the Social Security Administration, due to the incorporation of market risk into the discounting of future benefits.

I show analytically how age dependence improves policy on both the intratemporal and intertemporal margins. I use detailed numerical simulations, calibrated with data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to generate robust policy implications: age dependence (1) lowers marginal taxes on average and especially on high-income young workers and (2) lowers average taxes on all young workers relative to older workers when private saving and borrowing are restricted. Finally, I calculate and characterize the welfare gains from age dependence. Despite its simplicity, age dependence generates a welfare gain equal to between 0·6% and 1·5% of aggregate annual consumption, and it captures more than 60% of the gain from reform to the dynamic optimal policy. The gains are due to substantial increases in both efficiency and equity.

These patterns are important for normative analysis of taxation toward the top of the distribution. Theoretical work should further focus on understanding implications of inequality of inherited wealth: the topic that has been neglected in the past, even though it is closely related to—more carefully studied, but arguably much less important in practice—externalities from giving.

As governments react with swift and severe measures in their ongoing fight to control the pandemic's spread, it is important to understand how these actions may disproportionately increase the risks for women both directly and indirectly with regard to sex and gender.Pregnant women are often among the most vulnerable groups during public health emergencies. In some cases, pregnant women face increased biological susceptibility to adverse health outcomes, as in the case of some respiratory infections. With other emergent coronaviruses, such as those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), pregnant women who became infected were found to be more likely than nonpregnant women to experience severe complications.2 It is still too early to tell whether this will be the case with COVID-19.In the ongoing pandemic, other factors may have a ripple effect that put women at increased risk even if the disease itself does not. As made clear during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the consequences of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks on uninfected pregnant women can be dire. Routine prenatal care appointments, if not interrupted or discontinued, may put women at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Overwhelmed hospitals struggling to function with staff and supply shortages may not be able to provide the high quality of care that all pregnant women and their newborns deserve, let alone respond to emergency obstetric complications. Furthermore, there is also a risk that life-saving treatments or vaccines will be denied to pregnant women over concern for fetal safety or a lack of data.3,4The fear of infection, concern for the well-being of friends and loved ones, uncertainty, disruption, and social isolation that have become part and parcel of daily life for many around the world will undoubtedly have profound effects on mental health on the population at large, but being pregnant during a global pandemic is likely to be even more frightening for many women. Although containment strategies, such as those that require women to deliver without a companion present, including partners and doulas, that have already been put into place in some cities in the United States,5 or those that separate newborns from their mothers immediately after birth if the mother is infected with COVID-196 may be clinically important to reduce transmission, they may also have profound short- and long-term mental health implications for women. Among women who have young children, previous research in Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam found that women who experience family-related stressful life events, such as illness or death within the household and financial uncertainty, are more likely to experience episodes of severe mental distress.7 With the ongoing need to social distance, family and community networks may struggle and pregnant and postpartum women may feel even more vulnerable and isolated over a lack of social support.The adverse effects of the pandemic in relation to women's reproductive health are not limited to pregnancy or motherhood. As movement restrictions are put into place, supply chains are disrupted, and businesses are shuttered, some women may be at increased risk of unintended pregnancy should it become difficult to obtain their regular contraceptive method or emergency contraceptives, if needed. Furthermore, some states within the United States have begun to impose restrictions on certain medical procedures that they deem to be elective, including abortion, suggesting they must be delayed until after the pandemic is over.8 Spikes in domestic violence during times of crisis are another area of grave concern for women's health, and as governments continue to put into place more extreme measures to enforce social distancing, for some women, more time at home may mean more time spent with an abusive partner. Fewer social interactions may also mean less accountability for perpetrators and fewer opportunities for others to intervene.Gender-related factors may also increase the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women globally. Women constitute a disproportionately high percentage of caregivers in both the formal and informal sectors.9 A large proportion of frontline health care professionals (nurses, community health workers, health technicians, etc.) is women who face a higher risk of infection, morbidity, and death as a result of their profession.9 At the same time, women more frequently serve as the primary caregivers within a household, which may further increase their risk of exposure. In the United States, 65% of unpaid family caregivers are estimated to be women and 80% of them care for someone aged 50 years or older.10 Outside of their caregiving role, women are overrepresented in the informal employment sector. In low-and middle-income countries, two-thirds of women who work do so as part of the informal economy with limited access to health care for themselves and their families.9 Containment and mitigation policies that limit women's ability to perform their duties without offering effective alternatives, such as closing of daycare facilities for their children or not providing paid sick leave, may result in unnecessary exposure to disease and increased family vulnerability.It is urgent that we adopt a gender lens to study the pandemic and its effects, including the policies and actions that are put into place at the global, country, and local levels. This may be especially important in disadvantaged populations and resource-poor communities, where women are especially vulnerable. The public health community must ensure that existing health and social services meant to support women in the face of their unique needs do not disappear in lieu of the all-encompassing focus on stopping the pandemic. Furthermore, we argue that special attention needs to be paid to ensure that informal caregivers are supported, informed, and protected. To avoid making existing gender disparities larger as a result of the pandemic, a special body at the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is urgently needed to track sex disaggregated data and analyze policies related to COVID-19 using a gender lens.Author Disclosure StatementNo competing financial interests exist.Funding InformationNo funding was received for this article.References1.

A growing class of place-based policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720;","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720;","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Disadvantaged, Economics, Subsidy, Public economics, Welfare, Unemployment, Public policy, Psychological intervention, Spatial mismatch, Economic growth, Market economy, Psychology, Psychiatry"

However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services. ( JEL R1, C8, C18)",John F.

Innovation Activities and Integration through Vertical Acquisitions,2019,[],Laurent Frésard; Gerard Hoberg; Gordon Phillips,Laurent Frésard; Gerard Hoberg; Gordon M Phillips,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz106,"Abstract We examine the determinants of vertical acquisitions using product text linked to product vocabulary from input-output tables. We find that the innovation stage is important in understanding vertical integration. R&amp;D-intensive firms are less likely to become targets of vertical acquisitions. In contrast, firms with patented innovation are more likely to sell to vertically related buyers. Firms’ R&amp;D intensity is a more important deterrent to their vertical acquisitions when the provision of innovation incentives by potential acquirers is more difficult. The role of patents in fostering vertical acquisitions is more prevalent when potential buyers face a higher risk of holdup.

Recent work has shown that investment decisions by conglomerate firms are consistent with value maximization; conglomerate firms trade at an average premium relative to single-segment firms when value weighting; and the valuation premia and discounts, both for conglomerates and single-segment firms, are driven by differences in the production of unique differentiated products. A profit-maximizing theory of the firm that considers how firms select their organizational structure can explain these recent findings and much of the large variation in findings in the conglomerate literature. We also review the literature showing how market imperfections create additional benefits and costs for internal capital markets and a potential for managerial distortions.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Southern California","Department of Finance and Business Economics, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Finance, Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742;","Department of Finance and Business Economics, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Finance, Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742;","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Conglomerate, Valuation (finance), Profit maximization, Market value, Enterprise value, Value (mathematics), Industrial organization, Business, Profit (economics), Microeconomics, Economics, Accounting, Paleontology, Machine learning, Computer science, Biology, Sedimentary rock"

Contrary to these theories, we find that, while across IPO cohorts young and mature firms acquire more than middle-aged firms, young and mature firms acquire for similar reasons. Firms with better growth opportunities and performance are more likely to make acquisitions irrespective of their lifecycle stage. Moreover, both young and mature firms have similar propensities to make diversifying acquisitions.

However, the term has yet to be accepted formally as a new geological epoch or era in Earth history. In this paper, we put forward the case for formally recognizing the Anthropocene as a new epoch in Earth history, arguing that the advent of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 provides a logical start date for the new epoch. We then explore recent trends in the evolution of the Anthropocene as humanity proceeds into the twenty-first century, focusing on the profound changes to our relationship with the rest of the living world and on early attempts and proposals for managing our relationship with the large geophysical cycles that drive the Earth's climate system.",Max Planck Institute for Chemistry; Georgetown University; Australian National University; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies; University of Geneva,"Climate Change Institute, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","Climate Change Institute, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","irs, nber","Anthropocene, Earth system science, Epoch (astronomy), Humanity, Environmental ethics, History, Deep time, Industrial Revolution, Astrobiology, Earth science, Geography, Geology, Political science, Computer science, Archaeology, Paleontology, Philosophy, Law, Oceanography, Stars, Physics, Computer vision"

Schankerman; John Van Reenen,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta9466,"The impact of R&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing ""spillovers"" : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and productmarket space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R&D because they operate more in technological niches.

Nigeria's gross domestic product is the largest in Africa, but its per capita income of about ₦770 000 (US$2000) is low with a highly inequitable distribution of income, wealth, and therefore, health. It is a picture of poverty amidst plenty. Nigeria is both a wealthy country and a very poor one. About 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, in social conditions that create ill health, and with the ever-present risk of catastrophic expenditures from high out-of-pocket spending for health. Even compared with countries of similar income levels in Africa, Nigeria's population health outcomes are poor, with national statistics masking drastic differences between rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and different regions. Nigeria also holds great promise. It is Africa's most populous country with 206 million people and immense human talent; it has a diaspora spanning the globe, 374 ethnic groups and languages, and a decentralised federal system of governance as enshrined in its 1999 Constitution. In this Commission, we present a positive outlook that is both possible and necessary for Nigeria to deliver equitable and optimal health outcomes. If the country confronts its toughest challenges—a complex political structure, weak governance, poor accountability, inefficiency, and corruption—it has the potential to vastly improve population health using a multisector, whole-of-government approach. Major obstacles include ineffective use of available resources, a dearth of robust population-level health and mortality data, insufficient financing for health and health care, sub-optimal deployment of available health funding to purchase health services, and large population inequities. Nigeria's demographic dividend has unguaranteed potential, with a high dependency ratio, a fast-growing population, and slow reduction in child mortality. Effective, quality reproductive, maternal, and child health services including family planning, and female education and empowerment are likely to accelerate demographic transition and yield a demographic dividend. This Commission was written in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has laid bare the inability of the public health system to confront new pathogens with threats to human health. However, despite a history of weak surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure, the scale up of COVID-19 diagnostics suggests that it is possible to rapidly improve other areas with sufficient local effort and resources. The Lancet Nigeria Commission aims to reposition future health policy in Nigeria to achieve universal health coverage and better health for all. This Commission presents analysis and evidence to support a positive and realistic future for Nigeria. The Commission addresses historically intractable challenges with a new narrative. Nigeria's path to greater prosperity lies through investment in the social determinants of health and the health system. Nigeria is not making use of its most precious resource—its people—by not adequately enacting policies to address preventable health problems. Health is influenced by access to quality health services, but other influencing factors lie outside this sphere. Huge gains in health can and must be made by ensuring adequate sanitation and hygiene, access to clean water, and food security, especially for children, and by addressing environmental threats to health, including air pollution. Nigeria has a young population, yet, despite spending more on health than many countries in west Africa (mostly from out-of-pocket payment), Nigerians have a lower life expectancy (54 years) than many of their neighbours. Nigeria's lower life expectancy is partially due to having more deaths in children of 5 years and younger than any other country in the world, including more populous India and China and countries experiencing widespread long-term conflict, such as Somalia. Chronic diseases and a high infectious disease burden, and an ever-present risk of epidemics of Lassa fever, meningitis, and cholera, present additional challenges. A rising population and inadequate infrastructure development over the past 30 years have contributed to increasing deaths from trauma through road injuries and conflicts driven by inequitable distribution of resources. Addressing Nigeria's health challenges requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to prevent ill health. This means investing in highly cost-effective health-promoting policies and interventions, which have extremely high cost–benefit ratios, and offering clear political benefits for implementation. Interventions are needed to improve child nutrition, reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, address unmet family planning needs, and improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Key messages•We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state. Health is a unique political lever, which to date has been under-utilised as a mechanism to rally populations. Good health can be at the core of the rebirth of a patriotic national identity and sense of belonging. A commitment to a ""One Nation, One Health"" policy would prioritise the attainment of Universal Health Coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, who also bear the highest disease burden.•We recommend that prevention should be at the heart of health policy given Nigeria's young population. This will require a whole-of-government approach and community engagement. An explicit consideration of equity in the implementation of programmes and provision of social welfare, education and employment opportunities should be paramount.•We propose an ambitious programme of healthcare reform to deliver a centrally determined, locally delivered health system. The goal of government should be to provide health insurance coverage for 83 million poor Nigerians who cannot afford to pay premiums. Implementation of a reinvigorated National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP III) should be supported by structured and explicit approaches to ensure that Federal, State and Local Governments deliver and are held accountable for non-delivery. NSHDP III should be supported by a ring-fenced budget and have a longer horizon of at least a decade during which common rules should apply to all parts of the system.•At the same time, the system should encourage innovation. Future health system reform should engage communities to ensure that existing nationally driven schemes have local buy-in and are sustainable. Further, since more than 50% of health services are provided in the private sector, often with poor quality and high costs, reforming the policy and regulatory landscape to unleash the market potential of the private sector is important.•We outline options for improving health financing and ensuring better accountability and distribution of resources. The rationalised governance schemes we have proposed should improve the efficient use of existing resources devoted to health. Ultimately, the proportion of spending allocated to health needs to be increased. We envision a future of Nigeria's health without foreign aid. This will require substantial increase in domestic investments. Foreign aid (multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic) has led to fragmentation of the already complex health development landscape, with huge asymmetries in legitimacy between foreign actors and the Nigerian state as well as weak accountability. Defragmenting and decolonizing the Nigerian health landscape requires domesticating health financing.•We recommend a whole system assessment of the invest-ment needs in Nigeria's health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Nigeria's health security system. Nigeria needs better manufacturing capacity for essential health products, medicines and vaccines, the provision of diagnostics, surveillance and preventive public health measures in health facilities and community settings, as well as other preventive and curative measures.•We call on the Federal Government, working with state governments, to fund and lead the development of standards for the digitisation of health records and better data collection, registration and quality assurance systems. A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. •We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state.

A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. We call for the thoughtful use of existing institutions as an approach to achieve better governance and prioritisation of health. Although corruption has undermined the Nigerian health system, we can harness existing institutions for the benefit of population health. All levels of Government in Nigeria (federal, state, and local), and traditional leadership structures, civil society, the private sector, religious organisations, and communities, influence health. Efforts towards a balance between centralisation and localisation should focus on common policies, standards, and accountability. Concurrently, there is an equal need for localisation of implementation, meaning actual community and local government ownership of health service delivery. All three levels of Government are crucial, and we provide recommendations for each level. Differences in regional needs and context must also dictate programmes and interventions. What is needed in the northeast, in a context of ongoing insecurity and a crisis of internally displaced persons, is quite different from needs in wealthier, more secure urban centres, or in the face of the different level of insecurity found in oil-producing areas in the Niger Delta. Prioritisation of health requires additional funds. We have provided a clear investment case on health to convince politicians and governments that improved population health will reap political, demographic, and economic dividends. Our call for a whole-of-government approach to health will allow the delivery of multisectoral policies to address the social determinants of health, prioritise health-care expenditure to major causes of burden of diseases, and substantially increase healthy and productive lifespans. Nigeria's health system was built in an ad hoc way, layering traditional community health systems with colonial medicine aimed at maximising resource extraction. This origin has resulted in inbuilt inequalities, a dysfunctional focus on curative care, and a detrimental social distance from users and communities. Post-independence policies to redress problems have only been partially implemented. However, the current health system is sprawling, multifarious, disintegrated, and frequently inaccessible, with very minimal financial risk protection and low financial accessibility of services. Nigerians variously seek care from medical personnel and auxiliaries, community health workers, medicine vendors, marabouts and spiritual healers, traditional birth attendants, and other informal providers. The system relies on a mixture of quasi-tax-funding, fee-for-service, and minimal health insurance coverage. What kind of health system do Nigerians deserve, and should the country's leaders work towards? The core need of most Nigerians today is for accessible basic health services, and for this to be achieved, improvements in public sector delivery supported by an enhanced complementary private sector, including faith-based organisations, is the way forward. We lay out a path for Nigeria to move towards a system that, although remaining diverse, better serves the needs of the population. Within this diversity, we believe there is an opportunity for a ""one nation and one health"" approach, whereby Nigeria guarantees a minimum standard and delivery of health care for all with an emphasis on strengthening public and private (including faith-based and non-profit) systems. Nigeria should also leverage the private sector for certain functions, such as expanding innovation, discovery, and manufacturing capacities to claim a leadership role on the African continent and globally. Government investment in private industry should be mission-driven, supporting innovation and claiming dividends for society from its investments. Core functions of the health system require immediate attention, in particular, good quality health data. This Commission strongly recommends better recording, storage, and use of data. Paper systems are unworkable. A drive towards digitisation can result in major improvements, for both patient care and devolved health decision-making. Mobile digital technologies should allow a relatively rapid expansion of population health data and linked existing datasets. Human resources in rural and poor regions of the country are worsened by brain drain. We propose prioritising the optimal development and redistribution of health workers at all levels. A viable health system requires dedicated, efficient, and equitable health financing mechanisms, complemented by optional health insurance. Countries with systems comparable with Nigeria's, such as Ethiopia and Indonesia, have planned or implemented ambitious programmes to deliver health insurance coverage.","University of Medical Sciences, Ondo;

A major obstacle to designing evidence-based policies to improve diabetes outcomes in LMICs is the limited nationally representative data on the current patterns of treatment coverage. The objectives of this study are (1) to estimate the proportion of adults with diabetes in LMICs who receive coverage of recommended pharmacological and non-pharmacological diabetes treatment and (2) to describe country-level and individual-level characteristics that are associated with treatment.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of pooled, individual data from 55 nationally representative surveys in LMICs. Our primary outcome of self-reported diabetes treatment coverage was based upon population-level monitoring indicators recommended in the 2020 World Health Organization Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions. We assessed coverage of three pharmacological and three non-pharmacological treatments among people with diabetes. At the country level, we estimated the proportion of individuals reporting coverage by per-capita gross national income and geographic region. At the individual level, we used logistic regression models to assess coverage along several key individual characteristics including sex, age, BMI, wealth quintile, and educational attainment. In the primary analysis, we scaled sample weights such that countries were weighted equally.The final pooled sample from the 55 LMICs included 680,102 total individuals and 37,094 individuals with diabetes. Using equal weights for each country, diabetes prevalence was 9.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7-9.4), with 43.9% (95% CI, 41.9-45.9) reporting a prior diabetes diagnosis. Overall, 4.6% (95% CI, 3.9-5.4) of individuals with diabetes self-reported meeting need for all treatments recommended for them. Coverage of glucose-lowering medication was 50.5% (95% CI, 48.6-52.5); antihypertensive medication, 41.3% (95% CI, 39.3-43.3); cholesterol-lowering medication, 6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2); diet counseling, 32.2% (95% CI, 30.7-33.7); exercise counseling, 28.2% (95% CI, 26.6-29.8); and weight-loss counseling, 31.5% (95% CI, 29.3-33.7). Countries at higher income levels tended to have greater coverage. Female sex and higher age, BMI, educational attainment, and household wealth were also associated with greater coverage.Fewer than one in ten people with diabetes in LMICs receive coverage of guideline-based comprehensive diabetes treatment. Scaling-up the capacity of health systems to deliver treatment not only to lower glucose but also to address cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and high cholesterol are urgent global diabetes priorities.",Nsambya Hospital;

Among unmarried women with less than a high school education, the change in Medicaid eligibility reduced employment by approximately 13 percent to 16 percent.

IntroductionA leading proximate explanation for plunging employment during the Great Recession is plummeting demand for goods. According to this Keynesian labor demand hypothesis, when producers face unexpectedly low demand for their goods they respond by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. The underlying source of Keynesian labor demand could be nominal price stickiness and/or countercyclical desired markups. See Keynes (1939) for his embrace of both justifications.1We test for Keynesian labor demand across US industries in recent decades (1990 to 2011). To do so, we exploit how durability varies across seventy consumption and investment categories to predict relative goods demand movements over the business cycle. Relative demand shocks allow us to test whether markups move in the direction predicted by Keynesian labor demand.2 We also exploit information on which goods are luxuries versus necessities to predict relative demand, and take into account how price flexibility and capital-intensity of production vary across industries.According to consumer theory, durability should be a powerful determinant of the cyclical expenditures on a good. The more durable a good, the smaller is the average flow of expenditures on the good relative to the accumulated stock. For a good that lasts N years, increasing the stock by 1 percent requires an N percent increase in expenditures on the good relative to replacement expenditures. Thus any common macro shock (such as to technology or monetary policy) should hit demand for durables more dramatically. Similarly, demand for luxuries should be more cyclical than demand for necessities.Under sticky prices, firms should accommodate shifts in relative demand by firing or hiring workers rather than adjusting their prices. If capital is less flexible than labor in the short run, firms in flexible-price industries should adjust their prices more and adjust their production less than do sticky-price industries—controlling for the size of the demand shift they face. If target markups are countercyclical, however, then price stickiness may not be essential for a Keynesian labor demand response to goods demand shocks.We test for Keynesian labor demand using a variety of data. We use US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and insurance industry estimates of durability for seventy goods covering around 60 percent of GDP. These include most consumer and investment goods and services, but exclude government purchases and housing consumption. We estimate whether a good is a luxury or a necessity using cross-sectional Engel curves from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey. We assess price flexibility using US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) microdata on the frequency of price changes by good.We use quarterly NIPA data on consumption and investment from 1990 to 2011 to test whether durability and luxuriousness succeed in predicting the cyclicality of expenditures. Durability is a strong predictor. Bringing in data from the US Current Employment Survey, we find that durability is also highly correlated with employment growth across industries—including during the Great Recession. Finally, we incorporate the US Bureau of Labor Statistics KLEMS data on production, prices, and inputs across detailed industries. This allows us to contrast movements in labor’s productivity with its real wage, identifying whether producers move away from constant-markup labor demand in response to goods demand shocks.We find that industries producing goods that are more durable, while displaying much more cyclical employment and output, exhibit countercyclical relative markups. This countercyclical increase in markups is sufficiently large that relative prices of durables do not fall in recessions. (By contrast, sectoral total factor productivity [TFP] movements play little role in explaining the lack of cyclicality in durables’ relative prices.) Our evidence rejects flexible-price labor demand under a constant markup, but is consistent with Keynesian labor demand. This cyclical pricing for durables could reflect intentional markup movements, rather than being the byproduct of price stickiness. In fact, a model with countercyclical intended markups for durables, but flexible pricing in general, would arguably explain the data better than a sticky-price model.Despite its prominence in business cycle theorizing, there have been surprisingly few tests for Keynesian labor demand. Most have been based on aggregate time series, such as Galí and Rabanal (2004) and Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006). More recently, a number of studies have exploited regional variation to test whether goods demand drives employment. Examples include Feyrer and Sacerdote (2011), Nakamura and Steinsson (2011), and Mian and Sufi(2012). Mulligan (2010) looks at seasonal movements in labor supply and employment. Our study complements these by looking at cross-industry evidence. Thus, our approach is similar to Shea (1993) and Nekarda and Ramey (2011), who examine the impact of an industry’s downstream demand (Shea) and its share of government purchases (Nekarda and Ramey) on industry price and quantity. Chang, Hornstein, and Sarte (2009) examine how employment responds to industry-specific productivity shocks, and how that response depends on the use of inventories and pricing frequency in the industry.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we lay out a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to illustrate the key forces that motivate our demand predictors. Section III briefly describes the data sets we use. Section IV presents the main results, and section V concludes.II. ModelIn this section we use a multisector DSGE model to demonstrate how relative demand shocks affect markups under Keynesian versus classical labor demand. Here the source of Keynesian labor demand is sticky prices, rather than countercyclical intended markups. We incorporate heterogeneity in the durability of goods, the capital intensity of firms’ production, and the frequency of price changes. After sketching the key model features, we use a simplified version of the model to illustrate analytically how movements in relative quantities and prices across sectors differ depending on whether the model is Keynesian or classical (i.e., sticky or flexible prices).3 We then calibrate and simulate the full-blown model to get some quantitative sense of these movements.A. FirmsDurable (Yd) and nondurable (Yn) final goods are produced from intermediate goods, which are produced by two types of firms: those with high- and low-capital-intensity technologies. Competitive final goods producers use the following production functionwhere Yjf,t are composite intermediate goods produced (by competitive firms) according towhere ε > 1. Individual intermediate goods producers are monopolistically competitive and produce using a constant returns to scale (CRS) production functionwhere kjf,t(l) and njf,t(l) are capital and labor services employed by firm l in sector jf at time t, Ajf,t is sector-specific TFP, j = {d,n} indexes the type of good produced, and f = {h,l} denotes the technology used. Sectoral price indices, Pj,t and Pjf,t, expressed as functions of individual prices pjf,t(l), can be derived via standard cost minimization.Capital and labor flow freely between firms in the same sector, which implies, under CRS production, that nominal marginal costs and capital-labor ratios will be equated across firms in the same sector. However, as will become clear when we discuss household supply of factor inputs, imperfect capital mobility will allow marginal costs to vary across sectors. Furthermore, different production technologies across sectors imply different slopes for sectoral marginal cost curves. In particular, firms that produce with more capital-intensive technologies (larger αf) will require a greater increase in the flexible labor factor to effect a given short-run increase in production (i.e., their marginal cost curves are steeper).Finally, goods prices are sticky. We use the Calvo (1983) assumption whereby monopolistically competitive firms change their prices with a constant probability of (1 – θif). We allow θjf to vary by sector, and will also consider perfect price flexibility (θjf = 0, ∀jf ).B. HouseholdsHouseholds get utility from nondurable and durable consumption and disutility from working. Let Cn,t denote nondurable consumption, Cd,t durable consumption expenditures, the stock of the durable consumption good, and Nt labor supply. Households maximize expected discounted utilityand the stock of the durable consumption good evolves according towhere δ is the depreciation rate and S′′ governs adjustment costs on durables expenditures. Following Barsky, House, and Kimball (2007), the functional forms for household preferences arewhere σ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ψ determines the relative preference for nondurables versus durables, η is the elasticity of substitution between the two goods, ϕ is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, and χ governs the level of disutility from labor supply.Greater durability implies that any increase in consumption requires a more dramatic increase in expenditure. To increase consumption of the durable good by 1 percent from a steady state level requires an annual increase in expenditure of 1/δ percent, whereas a 1 percent increase in nondurables consumption requires only a 1 percent increase in expenditure. This motivates our use of durability as a shifter of goods demand and, because a larger increase in expenditure will call forth a larger increase in hours worked, labor demand as well.The household also owns the economy’s stock of physical capital (Ks), sets the utilization rate of capital (u), and rents capital services to firms in a competitive market. The relationship between capital services, utilization, and the physical capital stock isThe accumulation equation for capital mirrors that for durables consumption:where Ijf,t denotes investment that adds to the sector-jf capital stock. Note that Ijf,t is distinct from investment expenditures, which are given byInvestment expenditures include maintenance costs arising from capital utilization, . The cost function a(ṡ) is increasing, convex, and zero in steady state. In addition, investment is affected by investment-specific productivity ; greater productivity means less expenditure is required to achieve a given increase in the capital stock.Importantly, we have assumed each sector has a separate capital stock, which means that capital is (partially) fixed in the short run. Capital services can adjust immediately due to time-varying utilization, but utilization costs make utilization less than perfectly flexible. Capital stocks adjust fully over time, but the speed depends on investment adjustment costs.Households also supply labor to firms in each sector, and this process is intermediated by monopolistically competitive unions who have the power to set wages (Erceg, Henderson, and Levin 2000). The unions face Calvo frictions, altering wages with a constant probability of 1 – θw. Because wage stickiness does not vary by sector and labor supply across sectors is assumed to be perfectly elastic (Nt = ∑j,fNjf,t ), (nominal) wages Wt will be equalized across sectors.C. Analytical DiscussionBefore presenting numerical simulations, we use a stripped-down version of our model to analytically illustrate how cyclical movements in relative sector quantities, prices, and markups behave under sticky versus flexible prices. We assume the economy starts in steady state and evaluate the immediate response to an expansionary aggregate shock at time t. The stripped-down model features a constant aggregate capital stock, with the distribution of capital services across sectors fixed at time t but perfectly mobile by t + 1 (fixed capital utilization and no investment adjustment costs). We also assume durables goods are very long-lived (δ sufficiently small that the shadow value of durables is nearly invariant to short-lived shocks, as in Barsky, House, and Kimball 2007).With sufficiently long-lived durables, household optimization requireswhere hatted variables are log deviations from steady-state values. Furthermore, the law of motion for durables implies ; all produced goods are consumed ; the production functions are ; marginal costs are ; and markups are given by . Combining these expressions, we haveWe first consider a flexible-price economy. Markups are constant at μj = ε/(ε – 1). If sectors have the same capital intensities, equation (2) shows that labor will expand more in the durables sector. Thus, relative output, marginal costs, and prices also increase. Note that these relative movements do not depend on the underlying shock causing the expansion, but the movements are even larger if the source is a positive aggregate TFP shock.The results differ under sticky prices. Take the extreme of fixed prices, so that relative prices do not move. Equation (1) implies an increase in relative durables output, and thus labor and marginal costs. Therefore, relative markups are countercyclical. If prices are not perfectly rigid but are equally sticky in the two sectors, one can show that relative output, labor, and prices are procyclical, while relative markups are countercyclical.4 Thus, the primary (qualitative) difference between flexible and sticky prices is the behavior of relative markups.We have derived these predictions for relative movements in durables holding other characteristics—such as price flexibility, capital intensity, and TFP—fixed across sectors. This is important. For example, if durables prices were perfectly flexible and nondurables perfectly rigid, the relative durables markup would be procyclical and, under some parameters, relative labor could be countercyclical. Likewise, if the aggregate expansion was caused by a shock to durables TFP (Ad,t > An,t), one can show that, under sticky prices, the relative durables markup would again be procyclical (e.g., assuming η = 1 and αj = α). In our subsequent empirical analysis, therefore, we will control for variables that might be correlated with durability.So far, we have analyzed the response of durables relative to nondurables, but the model also predicts relative movements across goods on other dimensions, holding durability constant. Optimal demand by final (durable or nondurable) goods producers implieswhere h and l denote high- and low-capital-intensity firms. Assuming equally sticky prices in the two subsectors, one can derive the following expression for relative markupsso that higher-capital-intensity production implies a countercyclical markup. The sign of the relative movements in other variables depends on parameter values, although the more capital-intensive good typically has higher marginal costs and prices, but lower output.We can also use equation (3) to analyze how differences in price stickiness affect relative movements, now letting h and l denote firms with high and low price stickiness. We get the following relationship between relative labor and relative markups:That is, relative labor (and thus output and marginal costs) will move in the opposite direction of relative markups (and prices). Whether the relative markups are procyclical or countercyclical, however, depends on the nature of the underlying shock. Monetary (TFP) shocks that put upward (downward) pressure on prices will lead to countercyclical (procyclical) markups for the sector with stickier prices.D. Quantitative ResultsWe now calibrate and simulate the full-blown model. This allows us to move away from stark assumptions, such as the complete short-run fixity of capital, and consider realistic features like capital utilization and investment adjustment costs. We consider an empirically relevant amount of durability, capital intensity, and price stickiness in order to get a quantitative sense of the size of movements of key variables across sectors.Table 1 summarizes our model calibration. The parameters governing household preferences (σ, η, ϕ) and desired markups are set to standard values, and y is set to produce a steady-state nondurable-to-durable consumption ratio of 2.96. The annual depreciation rate of 5 percent matches the (weighted) average life span of durables in our data (i.e., twenty years). We set the household’s annual discount rate (3.34 percent) to match an investment-to-output ratio of 0.16, given the depreciation rate and an empirical aggregate capital share of 0.322. When we consider high- and low-capital intensity sectors, we use capital shares of ah = 0.475 and al = 0.169, which are the weighted average capital shares for consumption categories above and below the median capital share, respectively. Consistent with the microdata underlying the US CPI, the average price changes every four months, while high- and low-frequency firms set prices roughly every two and a half and twelve months. Wages are assumed to change once a year.Table 1. Model ParametersView Table ImageThe curvature of the utilization adjustment cost function is pinned down by the relationship between relative sector utilization rates and relative labor-to-capital ratios:Using Gorodnichenko and Shapiro (2011) data on twenty two-digit manufacturing sectors over the past thirty years, we regress utilization rates on labor-capital ratios (and time effects) to estimate an elasticity of 0.33, corresponding to a′′ = 2.0. Online appendix C has details (http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/c12756/appendix.pdf). For durables expenditure adjustment costs we set S′′ = 0.455/δ to match Cooper and Haltiwanger’s (2006) estimate of the elasticity of the investment rate with respect to Tobin’s Q.Finally, we need to calibrate the exogenous shock processes and the Taylor rule that governs monetary policy. With one exception, these parameters are monthly transformations of the quarterly estimates of Smets–Wouters (2007).5 We choose a larger volatility for the neutral technology shock to match the cyclicality of the aggregate labor share (i.e., inverse markup), but since our primary focus is on conditional impulse response functions, alternative calibrations of the volatility do not change the insights we draw from the model.Figures 1 to 4 show impulse responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock.6 We plot relative movements in output, labor, prices, and markups, where we measure markups using the inverse of the labor share. (Note that, under Cobb–Douglas production, fluctuations in markups are equivalent to fluctuations in the labor share. However, our test does not hinge on Cobb–Douglas production, and we will explicitly consider departures from it in our empirical analysis.) For scaling purposes, we also show the response of aggregate output (thin line). Figure 1 shows the relative durable-to-nondurable responses under sticky prices. For this exercise, the average capital intensity and price-change frequency in the two sectors are the same.7 Relative output (thick solid line) and labor (dashed line) are strongly procyclical, while the relative price response (dashed-dotted line) is also positive but muted by sticky prices. Relative markups (dotted line) are countercyclical, reflecting two forces: first and most important, price markups are more countercyclical for durables firms than for nondurables firms; second, within each sector the more labor-intensive subsector will gain market share because it has more flexibility to ramp up production. This composition effect will cause the labor share of both sectors to increase (decreasing the measured markup), but will be stronger for durables as their expenditures increase more.Fig. 1. Relative durables/nondurables response, sticky pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointThe immediate relative markup response is about 25 percent that of relative output, while the relative labor response is 25 percent greater than the output response. With wages equalized across sectors, . These magnitudes are, of course, dependent on our calibration. If the cost of varying capital utilization was zero (infinite), the relative labor response would be the same as (50 percent greater than) the relative output response.Figure 2 repeats the same exercise but with flexible prices in both sectors. (Note that wages are still sticky.) The monetary shock has smaller real effects under flexible prices; the aggregate output response is about 70 percent as big as the response under sticky prices. The relative price of durables now increases more, muting the shift in goods and labor demand toward durables. The relative markup response is nearly zero, with the small discrepancy solely reflecting the aforementioned composition effect.Fig. 2. Relative durables/nondurables response, flexible pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFigure 3 demonstrates the effect of price flexibility in another way. We once again allow for sticky prices, as in figure 1, but consider lowand high-price flexibility subsectors (1 – θl = 0.08, 1 –θl = 0.42) and focus on movements within the durables sector. The subsector with less price flexibility will exhibit a more sluggish price response, decreasing its relative price and increasing its relative output, labor input, and marginal costs. Thus, firms whose prices respond more slowly (on average) to the monetary shock see their relative markups decline. The magnitude of the relative markup movement is almost half the magnitude of the relative output response.Fig. 3. Relative low/high price flexibility responseNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFinally, figure 4 compares high- and low-capital-intensity subsectors (ah = 0.475, al = 0.169) within the durables sector, while keeping prices equally sticky. In response to an expansionary shock, firms with more capital-intensive technologies face steeper marginal cost curves. Although their relative markup decreases (as shown analytically), their higher marginal costs lead to a higher relative price and lower relative output. Note that the magnitude of the markup response is greater than the output response because the initial relative labor response is positive under our calibration, although this result is quite sensitive to the capital-intensity gap (ah – al) and fixity of the capital stock. At any rate, the relative labor response is more muted than under flexible prices, where markups are constant and the higher marginal costs of high-capital-intensity firms are completely passed through into relative prices, resulting in a larger decrease in relative output and a decrease in relative hours.Fig. 4. Relative high/low capital intensity response, sticky pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointTo recap, the Keynesian labor demand hypothesis is that firms respond to unexpectedly low demand for their goods by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. Equivalently, if marginal cost curves are upward sloping, firms increase their markups. In this section we have considered one possible source of this behavior—nominal price stickiness—and have shown that the relative markups of more durable and more capital-intensive goods are (essentially) constant under flexible prices but countercyclical under sticky prices.8 In our empirical analysis, we will exploit variation across different types of goods to test this prediction of Keynesian labor demand.The model is also helpful for clarifying why we do not simply examine the cyclicality of the aggregate markup in the data. The reason is that, even under sticky prices, the aggregate markup can be uncorrelated with output. This is what happens, for example, in the Smets–Wouters (2007) model estimated on US data. The reason is that the aggregate markup responds positively to some expansionary shocks but negatively to others. We demonstrate this in figures 5 and 6, which show impulse responses to all four aggregate shocks in our DSGE model. We scale the shocks to have the same initial effect on aggregate output (figure 5), while figure 6 shows the different aggregate markup responses to the various shocks. Of course, one could address this by conditioning on particular aggregate shocks à la Galí (1999). But we pursue a different, complementary approach of examining how relative markups respond to relative demand shocks across industries.Fig. 5.

Evidence on Durability and the Cyclicality of ExpendituresWe now construct demand predictors across industries. We start with the BLS’s classification of goods in the CPI into seventy Expenditure Classes (ECs). (See appendix 6 in http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch17.pdf.) We combine four pairs of ECs and drop five others due to missing NIPA data or overlap with NIPA investment categories, leaving us with sixty-one consumer goods.9 We then add nine categories of investment from NIPA, leaving us with a total of seventy expenditure categories. Online appendix table 1 provides the full list.For each of these seventy categories, we create two demand predictors. The first is based on the good’s durability, and the second is based on the Engel curve slope for the good (i.e., the extent to which the good is a luxury or necessity). We also construct two variables specific to each category that should affect how prices and costs respond to demand: the frequency of price change and the importance of capital versus labor in producing the good.A. DurabilityOf our seventy goods, twenty-eight are classified by NIPA as durable goods (nineteen of the sixty-one consumer goods are durables, and all nine of the investment goods). We use two sources to quantify the durability of the durables. A primary source is life expectancy tables from a major property-casualty insurance company, which we use for seventeen goods. For autos, tires, and the nine investment categories we use estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=10&step=1).Among the twenty-eight durable goods, the extent of durability varies widely. It is over thirty years for residential structures and three types of commercial buildings. For business equipment it ranges from four to eleven years (with information equipment and software at the less durable end, presumably due to obsolescence). Durability also varies among the nineteen consumer durables. At the low end are clothing categories (less than five years) and at the upper end are appliances and electronics (closer to ten years). We classify the remaining forty-two consumption categories as nondurables (i.e., lasting less than a year). These include food and services.B. Engel CurvesWhether a good is a luxury or necessity should also help predict cyclicality of demand. To estimate Engel curves, we turn to the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview Surveys. We pool CE crosssections from 1982 to 2010 to estimate Engel elasticities for our sixty-one consumer goods and for housing services.10 The CE Interview Survey lumps together all food for home consumption, so for these categories we estimate a common elasticity.Households are interviewed up to four consecutive quarters on their detailed expenditures. We estimate Engel elasticities by regressing spending on each category from the household’s second through fourth interviews on the sum of its spending during those same three quarters. We instrument for the log of a household’s total expenditures in its final three interviews based on its (logged) total and nondurable expenditures from the first quarterly interview, as well as its (logged) before-tax annual income reported in both the first and final interviews. We instrument to limit attenuation bias from measurement error in household total expenditures. We do not log expenditures for individual categories, the dependent variables in the second stage, as these are zero in some cases. Instead we divide the household’s spending on a category by mean spending on that category across households. Thus our elasticities are relative to mean household spending on that category.11For the nine NIPA i",Stanford University; University of Rochester; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; University of Rochester and NBER; Stanford University and NBER,Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; University of Rochester and NBER; Stanford University and NBER,"irs, microdata, nber, bureau, bea, federal reserve","Economics, New Keynesian economics, Labor demand, Keynesian economics, Business cycle, Investment (military), Consumption (sociology), Capital good, Exploit, Aggregate demand, Monetary economics, Macroeconomics, Monetary policy, Unemployment, Economy, Goods and services, Social science, Computer security, Sociology, Politics, Political science, Computer science, Law"

First, it provides an in‐depth examination of the Federal Reserve measure of capacity utilization and shows that it is closer to a cyclical indicator than a measure of long‐run variations of normal utilization. Other measures, such as the Average Workweek of Capital or the National Emergency Utilization Rate are more appropriate for examining long‐run changes in utilization. Second, and related to that, it argues that a relatively stationary measure of utilization is not consistent with any theory of the determination of utilization. Third, based on data on the lifetime of fixed assets it shows that for the issues around the “utilization controversy” the long run is a period after thirty years or more.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify sociodemographic factors associated with neighborhood tenure and relocation after the first cancer diagnosis among U.S. adult cancer survivors and patients. Methods Based on a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian adults (≥18 years, n = 185,637) from the 2013–2018 National Health Interview Survey, we compared neighborhood tenure between adults with and without a history of cancer, and identified factors associated with their neighborhood tenure and relocation after the first cancer diagnosis, using propensity score matching, and logistic regression models with survey design incorporated. Results Among adults with cancer (9.0%), 39.6% had a neighborhood tenure ≤10 years (vs. 61.2% among those without cancer), and 25.6% (equivalent to 5.4 million) relocated after their first cancer diagnosis. The odds of having shorter neighborhood tenure was higher among the cancer group in the propensity-matched samples (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.05–1.06; n = 17,259). Among cancer survivors, the odds of neighborhood relocation were negatively associated with increasing age, perceived neighborhood social cohesion, having high school level education, and being married; while positively associated with having family income below the poverty threshold, being uninsured, and living in non-Northeast regions.

For the U.S., business exit is countercyclical and fairly common, with about 7.5 percent of firms exiting annually in recent years. Both the high level and the cyclicality of exit are driven by very small firms and establishments. We then explore a range of alternative measures of business exit, including novel measures based on paycheck issuance and phone-tracking data, which indicate exit was elevated in certain sectors during the first year of the pandemic. The evidence is mixed, however; many industries have likely seen lower-than-usual exit rates, and exiting businesses do not appear to represent a large share of U.S. employment.

The data show that 50 percent of adults worldwide have an account at a formal financial institution, though account penetration varies widely across regions, income groups and individual characteristics. In addition, 22 percent of adults report having saved at a formal financial institution in the past 12 months, and 9 percent report having taken out a new loan from a bank, credit union or microfinance institution in the past year. Although half of adults around the world remain unbanked, at least 35 percent of them report barriers to account use that might be addressed by public policy. Among the most commonly reported barriers are high cost, physical distance, and lack of proper documentation, though there are significant differences across regions and individual characteristics.

The World Development Report 1992 explores the links between economic development and the environment. The 1990 report on poverty, last year's report on development strategies, and this report constitute a trilogy on the goals and means of development. The main message of this year's report is the need to integrate environmental considerations into development policymaking. The report argues that continued, and even accelerated, economic and human development is sustainable and can be consistent with improving environmental conditions, but that this will require major policy, program, and institutional shifts. A twofold strategy is required. First, the positive links between efficient income growth and the environment need to be aggressively exploited. Second, strong policies and institutions need to be put in place which cause decision makers to adopt less damaging forms of behavior. Where tradeoffs exist between income growth and environmental quality, the report argues for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative policies. This approach will result in much less environmental damage.

Labor Supply Effects of Occupational Regulation: Evidence from the Nurse Licensure Compact,2016,[],Christina DePasquale; Kevin Stange,Christina DePasquale; Kevin Stange,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22344,"There is concern that licensure requirements impede mobility of licensed professionals to areas of high demand.Nursing has not been immune to this criticism, especially in the context of perceived nurse shortages and large expected future demand.The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) was introduced to solve this problem by permitting registered nurses to practice across state lines without obtaining additional licensure.We exploit the staggered adoption of the NLC to examine whether a reduction in licensure-induced barriers alters the nurse labor market.Using data on over 1.8 million nurses and other health care workers we find no evidence that the labor supply or mobility of nurses increases following the adoption of the NLC, even among the residents of counties bordering other NLC states who are potentially most affected by the NLC.This suggests that nationalizing occupational licensing will not substantially reduce labor market frictions.",Emory University; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; State Street (United States); University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"School of Public Policy University of Michigan 5236 Weill Hall 735 South State Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; participants at the Rollins School of Public Health, University of Virginia; Emory University 1602 Fishburne Dr. Atlanta, GA, 30322; School of Law, Ford School of Public Policy, ASHEcon 2014, APPAM 2014, ASSA","School of Public Policy University of Michigan 5236 Weill Hall 735 South State Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; participants at the Rollins School of Public Health, University of Virginia; Emory University 1602 Fishburne Dr. Atlanta, GA, 30322; School of Law, Ford School of Public Policy, ASHEcon 2014, APPAM 2014, ASSA","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Licensure, Occupational licensing, Registered nurse, Labour economics, Business, Nursing, Demographic economics, Psychology, Medicine, Economics, Microeconomics"

Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: an Intergenerational Perspective*,2019,[],Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie R. Jones; Sonya R. Porter,Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie R Jones; Sonya R Porter,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz042,"Abstract We study the sources of racial disparities in income using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989 to 2015. We document three results. First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks.

Strain,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.12453,"This study investigates whether minimum wage increases impact worker health in the United States. We consider self‐reported measures of general, mental, and physical health. We use data on lesser‐skilled workers from the 1993 to 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Among men, we find no evidence that minimum wage increases improve health; instead, we find that such increases lead to worse health outcomes, particularly among unemployed men. We find both worsening general health and improved mental health following minimum wage increases among women. These findings broaden our understanding of the full impacts of minimum wage increases on lesser‐skill workers.

The resulting time series reveals that the pace of racial income convergence has generally been steady but slow, quickening only during the 1940s and the modern Civil Rights era. I explore the interpretation of the time series with a model of intergenerational transmission of inequality in which racial differences in causal factors that determine income are very large just after the Civil War and which erode slowly across subsequent generations. “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.” —W.

Studying intergenerational mobility (IGM) requires longitudinal data across large spans of time as well as the ability to follow parents and children over multiple generations. Few longitudinal datasets meet this need. This article surveys available data and the current and potential issues surrounding the use of administrative records to vastly extend the study of IGM. First, we describe the U.S. Census Bureau’s current uses of administrative records in the linkage of households across household surveys such as the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), and the decennial censuses. Then, we describe the possibilities of creating additional parent-child linkages using the SIPP linked to decennial censuses and the ACS. Last, we outline our model to create linkages across earlier census data (e.g., 1980 and 1990) and contemporary surveys.",,,,"irs, census bureau, bureau","Census, American Community Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation, Current Population Survey, Survey data collection, Linkage (software), Geography, Record linkage, Population, Inequality, Demographic economics, Regional science, Demography, Sociology, Economics, Statistics, Mathematical analysis, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Mathematics, Gene"

It is intended to help policymakers, students, analysts, professors, program managers, and citizens find and use data related to all aspects of development, including those that help monitor progress toward the World Bank Group's two goals of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Six themes are used to organize indicators—world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links. As in past editions, World Development Indicators reviews global progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and provides key indicators related to poverty. WDI 2015 includes: * A selection of the most popular indicators across 214 economies and 14 country groups organized into six WDI themes * Thematic and regional highlights, providing an overview of global development trends * An in-depth review of the progress made toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals * A user guide describing resources available online and on mobile apps A complementary online data analysis tool is available this year to allow readers to further investigate global, regional, and country progress on the MDGs: data.worldbank.org/mdgs. Each of the remaining sections includes an introduction; six stories highlighting specific global, regional or country trends; and a table of the most relevant and popular indicators for that theme, together with a discussion of indicator compilation methodology.

We show that gaps in intergenerational mobility by race are significantly larger than those by region. In particular, there is no region in the United States where it is better to be poor and black compared to being equally poor and white. We also show that the expected rank of Hispanics falls between that of whites and blacks. We find that the low mobility in the Southeast of the US documented by Chetty et al (2014) is actually driven by low mobility by whites and that blacks who grew up in the Southeast actually experience higher mobility than blacks growing up in the Northeast and Midwest. We also directly examine the role of migration and find that it plays little role in explaining the regional heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility. Finally, we use a rich set of individual covariates available in the NLSY — including test scores — and show that these can explain much of the gaps by race/ethnicity.",University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy,Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy,"irs, federal reserve","Ethnic group, Geography, Economic geography, Demography, Demographic economics, Sociology, Anthropology, Economics"

From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and improved bank performance. Exploiting the cross‐state, cross‐time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median.

These differences in states' branching restrictions affect credit supply. In states more open to branching, small firms borrow at interest rates 80 to 100 basis points lower than firms operating in less open states. Firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks.

Finance plays a crucial role in the preponderance of theories of persistent inequality. Unsurprisingly, therefore, economic theory provides a rich set of predictions concerning both the impact of finance on inequality and about the relevant mechanisms. While subject to ample qualifications, the bulk of empirical research suggests that improvements in financial contracts, markets, and intermediaries expand economic opportunities and reduce inequality. Yet, there is a shortage of theoretical and empirical research on the potentially enormous impact of formal financial sector policies, such as bank regulations and securities law, on persistent inequality.

Extensive evidence is also found of agglomeration economies among manufacturing industries. In particular, supportive incumbent industrial structures for input and output markets are strongly linked to higher establishment entry rates.

Will Divestment from Employment‐Based Health Insurance Save Employers Money? The Case of State and Local Governments,2015,[],Jeremy D. Goldhaber‐Fiebert; David M.

But what if firms find it cheaper to have their employees obtain insurance from these sources, even after accounting for penalties (for nonprovision of insurance) and employee bonuses (to ensure the shift is cost neutral for employees)? State and local governments (SLGs) have strong incentives to consider the economics of such “divestment”; many have particularly large unfunded benefits liabilities. We investigated whether SLGs would save under two scenarios: (1) shifting all employees and under‐65 retirees to alternative sources of coverage and (2) shifting only employees whose household incomes indicate they would be eligible for federally‐subsidized coverage and all under‐65 retirees. Full divestment would cost SLGs more than they currently pay, due primarily to penalty costs. Selective divestment could save SLGs nearly $129 billion over 10 years at the expense of the federal government.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Creative Commons; Stanford University,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Stanford University Stanford, CA 943305-6019; Commons CHP/PCOR; Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-6019","Commons CHP/PCOR; Stanford University Stanford, CA 943305-6019; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-6019","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Divestment, Subsidy, Business, Incentive, Government (linguistics), Finance, State (computer science), Public economics, Labour economics, Economics, Microeconomics, Market economy, Linguistics, Philosophy, Algorithm, Computer science"

However, little empirical research has examined whether these payment systems should also include health insurers' administrative costs. We provide two sources of evidence that health insurers with a more morbid population have higher administrative costs. First, we show at the customer level a causal relationship between individual morbidity and individual administrative contacts with the insurer, using the weekly evolution of the number of individual customer contacts (calls, emails, in-person visits etc.) of a large Swiss health insurer. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the onset of a chronic illness causes on average a persistent increase of about 40% in individuals' contacts with the health insurer. Second, we provide evidence that this relationship also holds for total administrative costs at the insurer level. We study twenty years of Swiss health insurance market data and find a positive elasticity of around 1, indicating that, all else equal, an insurer with a more morbid population, equal to 1% more health care spending, faces about 1% higher administrative costs.",University of Zurich; Erasmus University Rotterdam; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis; University of Lucerne,"CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, 2594, AV, The Hague, the Netherlands; University of Lucerne, Faculty of Economics and Management, Frohburgstrasse 3, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics, Tribschenstrasse 21, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062, PA, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; University of Zurich, Department of Economics, Schönberggasse 1, 8001, Zurich, Switzerland","CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, 2594, AV, The Hague, the Netherlands; University of Lucerne, Faculty of Economics and Management, Frohburgstrasse 3, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics, Tribschenstrasse 21, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062, PA, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; University of Zurich, Department of Economics, Schönberggasse 1, 8001, Zurich, Switzerland","irs, nber, bureau","Payment, Health care, Population, Actuarial science, Health economics, Health insurance, Business, Demographic economics, Economics, Medicine, Finance, Environmental health, Economic growth"

We summarize how well the traditional trade-off and pecking order approaches explain these sources of variation and highlight their empirical shortcomings. We review recent research that attempts to address these shortcomings, much of which follows seven broad themes: (a) Important variables have been mismeasured in empirical tests, (b) the impact of leverage on nonfinancial stakeholders is important, (c) the supply side of capital affects corporate capital structure, (d) richer features of financial contracts have been underresearched, (e) value effects due to capital structure appear to be modest over wide ranges of leverage, (f) estimates of leverage adjustment speeds are biased, and (g) capital structure dynamics have not been adequately considered. Much progress has been made in addressing these issues, some of which has led to the study of an expanded range of capital structure topics, including debt maturity, loan and covenant characteristics, collateral effects, and alternative financing sources such as leasing and credit lines.

The model fits very well a number of empirical observations, including the observed wealth distribution for entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital, and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some high‐ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth concentration.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,"Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, National Bureau of Economic Research, and University of Minnesota; Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System","Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, National Bureau of Economic Research, and University of Minnesota; Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System","national bureau of economic research, bureau, federal reserve","Entrepreneurship, Capital (architecture), Investment (military), Economics, Aggregate (composite), Distribution (mathematics), Labour economics, Distribution of wealth, Microeconomics, Monetary economics, Finance, Inequality, History, Mathematical analysis, Materials science, Mathematics, Archaeology, Politics, Political science, Law, Composite material"
Counterproductive Sustainable Investing: The Impact Elasticity of Brown and Green Firms,2023,[],Samuel M. Hartzmark; Kelly Shue,Samuel M. Hartzmark; Kelly Shue,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4359282,"We develop a new measure of impact elasticity, defined as a firm's change in environmental impact due to a change in its cost of financing. We show empirically that a reduction in financing costs for firms that are already green leads to small improvements in impact at best. In contrast, increasing financing costs for brown firms leads to large negative changes in firm impact. Thus, sustainable investing that directs capital away from brown firms and toward green firms may counterproductive, in that it makes brown firms more brown without making green firms more green. We further show that brown firms face very weak incentives to become more green. Due to a mistaken focus on percentage reductions in emissions, the sustainable investing movement primarily rewards green firms for economically trivial reductions in their already low levels of emissions.",Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University,Boston College - Carroll School of Management; Yale School of Management; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Boston College - Carroll School of Management; Yale School of Management; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),"national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Incentive, Business, Sustainability, Natural resource economics, Green innovation, Economics, Industrial organization, Microeconomics, Ecology, Biology"

Financial Development and Economic Growth: Views and Agenda,1999,[],Ross Levine,Ross Levine,https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-1678,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers21 Jun 2013Financial Development and Economic Growth: Views and AgendaAuthors/Editors: Ross LevineRoss Levinehttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-1678SectionsAboutPDF (3.4 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:October 1996 A growing body of theoretical and empirical work would push even skeptics toward the belief that the development of financial markets and institutions is critical to economic growth, rather than a sideshow or a passive response to growth. Levine argues that the preponderance of theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence suggests a positive, first-order relationship between financial development and economic growth. There is even evidence that the level of financial development is a good predictor of future rates of economic growth, capital accumulation, and technological change. Moreover, cross-country, case-study, industry-level, and firm-level analyses document extensive periods when financial development (or the lack thereof) crucially affects the speed and pattern of economic development. Levine explains what the financial system does and how it affects, and is affected by, economic growth. Theory suggests that financial instruments, markets, and institutions arise to mitigate the effects of information and transaction costs. A growing literature shows that differences in how well financial systems reduce information and transaction costs influence savings rates, investment decisions, technological innovation, and long-run growth rates. A less developed theoretical literature shows how changes in economic activity can influence financial systems. Without minimizing the role of institutions, Levine advocates a functional approach to understanding the role of financial systems in economic growth. This approach focuses on the ties between growth and the quality of the functions provided by the financial system. Levine discourages a narrow focus on one financial instrument, such as money, or a particular institution, such as banks. Instead, he addresses the more comprehensive, and difficult, question: What is the relationship between financial structure and the functioning of the financial system? More research is needed on financial development. Why does financial structure change as countries grow, for example? Why do countries at similar stages of economic development have different looking financial systems? Are there long-run economic growth advantages to adopting legal and policy changes that create one type of financial structure rather than another?

"Separations, Sorting, and Cyclical Unemployment",2017,[],Andreas Mueller,Andreas I. Mueller,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20121186,"This paper establishes a new fact about the compositional changes in the pool of unemployed over the US business cycle. Using microdata from the Current Population Survey for the years 1962–2012, it documents that in recessions the pool of unemployed shifts toward workers with high wages in their previous job and that these shifts are driven by the high cyclicality of separations for high-wage workers. The paper finds that standard theories of wage setting and unemployment have difficulty in explaining these patterns and evaluates a number of alternative theories that do better in accounting for the new fact.

This article presents a conceptual definition of sprawl based on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity mixed uses, and proximity. Sprawl is defined as a condition of land use that is represented by low values on one or more of these dimensions. Each dimension is operationally defined and tested in 13 urbanized areas. Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.

The Role of Neighbourhood and Workplace Ethnic Contexts in the Formation of Inter-ethnic Partnerships: A Native Majority Perspective,2019,[],Leen Rahnu; Allan Puur; Tom Kleinepier; Tiit Tammaru,Leen Rahnu; Allan Puur; Tom Kleinepier; Tiit Tammaru,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10680-019-09528-x,"Although inter-ethnic encounters take place in multiple domains of daily life, ethnic intermarriage has typically been studied in relation to places of residence but rarely in relation to workplaces. Focussing on migrants is the most common approach to the study of intermarriage, whereas focussing on native majority population is less frequent. This study investigates an extent to which the share of immigrants at the workplace establishment and in the residential neighbourhood influences the natives' likelihood of choosing a foreign-born partner. The analysis is based on longitudinal register data that cover all residents of Finland in 1999-2014. We focus on native Finnish women and men born from 1981 to 1995. We estimated a discrete-time event history model with competing risks, distinguishing the first-partnership formation with a foreign-born partner and a native-born partner. The share of immigrants in the residential neighbourhood and workplace both increase the propensity of choosing a foreign-born partner, but the share of immigrants in workplace tends to have a stronger bearing on the partner choice. High exposure to other ethnic groups in one domain is associated with reduced effect of the additional exposure occurring in another domain. The effect of ethnic diversity at workplace tends to be more pronounced among women. The study contributes to the literature by examining both the independent effect of residential and workplace contexts on the formation of ethnically mixed partnership among the native majority population, as well as the interaction between the two.",Delft University of Technology; Tallinn University; University of Tartu,"Estonian Institute for Population Studies, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia; OTB - Faculty of Architecture and Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Centre for Migration and Urban Studies, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","Estonian Institute for Population Studies, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia; OTB - Faculty of Architecture and Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Centre for Migration and Urban Studies, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","bea, irs","Ethnic group, Neighbourhood (mathematics), Immigration, Residence, Demographic economics, Geography, Population, General partnership, Sociology, Demography, Social psychology, Psychology, Political science, Economics, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Archaeology, Anthropology, Law"

First, both the CEO's low fractional ownership (the Jensen–Murphy incentives measure) and its negative relationship with firm size can be quantitatively reconciled with optimal contracting, and thus need not reflect rent extraction. Second, the dollar change in wealth for a percentage change in firm value, divided by annual pay, is independent of firm size, and therefore a desirable empirical measure of incentives. Third, incentive pay is effective at solving agency problems with multiplicative impacts on firm value, such as strategy choice. However, additive issues such as perk consumption are best addressed through direct monitoring.",New York University; University of Pennsylvania,"New York University & NBER; New York University.; Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania#TAB#","New York University & NBER; New York University.; Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania#TAB#","irs, nber","Incentive, Microeconomics, Economics, Multiplicative function, Consumption (sociology), Value (mathematics), Production (economics), Liberian dollar, Agency cost, Principal–agent problem, Agency (philosophy), Econometrics, Mathematics, Finance, Statistics, Social science, Corporate governance, Sociology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Mathematical analysis, Shareholder"

The Flattening Firm and Product Market Competition: The Effect of Trade Liberalization on Corporate Hierarchies,2010,[],María Guadalupe; Julie Wulf,Maria Guadalupe; Julie Wulf,https://doi.org/10.1257/app.2.4.105,"This paper establishes a causal effect of product market competition on various characteristics of organizational design. Using a unique panel dataset on firm hierarchies of large US firms (1986–1999) and a quasi-natural experiment (trade liberalization), we find that competition leads firms to flatten their hierarchies: firms reduce the number of positions between the CEO and division managers, and firms increase the number of positions reporting directly to the CEO. The results illustrate how firms redesign their organizational structure through a set of complementary choices in response to changes in their environment. We discuss several possible interpretations of these changes.

Using evidence from confidential Census data on U.S. law offices on lawyers’ organization and earnings, we study the extent to which the mechanism suggested by Lucas (1978) and Rosen (1982), a scale of operations effect linking spans of control and earnings inequality, is responsible for increases in inequality. We first show that earnings inequality among lawyers increased substantially between 1977 and 1992, and that the distribution of partner-associate ratios across offices changed in ways consistent with the hypothesis that coordination costs fell during this period. We then propose a 'hierarchical production function' in which output is the product of skill and time and estimate its parameters, applying insights from the equilibrium assignment literature. We find that coordination costs fell broadly and steadily during this period, so that hiring one’s first associate leveraged a partner’s skill by about 30% more in 1992 than 1977. We find also that changes in lawyers’ hierarchical organization account for about 2/3 of the increase in earnings inequality among lawyers in the upper tail, but a much smaller share of the increase in inequality between lawyers in the upper tail and other lawyers. These findings indicate that new organizational efficiencies potentially explain increases in inequality, especially among individuals toward the top of the earnings distribution.",National Bureau of Economic Research; IE University; Northwestern University; Centre for Economic Policy Research,Northwestern University - Department of Management & Strategy; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); IE Business School,Northwestern University - Department of Management & Strategy; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); IE Business School,"irs, national bureau of economic research, cepr, nber, bureau","Inequality, Earnings, Accounting, Economics, Earnings response coefficient, Earnings management, Business, Labour economics, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics"
It's the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent,2013,[],Steven N. Kaplan; Joshua Rauh,Steven N Kaplan; Joshua Rauh,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.27.3.35,"One explanation that has been proposed for rising inequality is that technical change allows highly talented individuals, or “superstars” to manage or perform on a larger scale, applying their talent to greater pools of resources and reaching larger numbers of people, thus becoming more productive and higher paid. Others argue that managerial power has increased in a way that allows those at the top to receive higher pay, that social norms against higher pay levels have broken down, or that tax policy affects the distribution of surpluses between employers and employees. We offer evidence bearing on the different theories explaining the rise in inequality in the United States over recent decades. First we look the increase in pay at the highest income levels across occupations. We consider the income share of the top 1 percent over time. And we turn to evidence on inequality of wealth at the top. In looking at the wealthiest Americans, we find that those in the Forbes 400 are less likely to have inherited their wealth or to have grown up wealthy. The Forbes 400 of today also are those who were able to access education while young and apply their skills to the most scalable industries: technology, finance, and mass retail. We believe that the US evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1 percent is most consistent with a “superstar”-style explanation rooted in the importance of scale and skill-biased technological change. It is less consistent with an argument that the gains to the top 1 percent are rooted in greater managerial power or changes in social norms about what managers should earn.",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Stanford University,"Professor of Finance, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California; Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Neubauer Family Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois; Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; STANFORD U","Professor of Finance, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California; Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Neubauer Family Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois; Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; STANFORD U","bea, irs, national bureau of economic research, bureau","Economics, Inequality, Economic inequality, Superstar, Labour economics, Argument (complex analysis), Distribution (mathematics), Scale (ratio), Technological change, Demographic economics, Business, Macroeconomics, Advertising, Mathematical analysis, Physics, Mathematics, Quantum mechanics, Biochemistry, Chemistry"

Here we present a method for describing individual and team citation impact that both is computationally feasible and can be applied in standard, wide-scale databases. We track individuals across collaboration networks to define an individual citation index and examine outcomes when each individual works alone or in teams. Studying 24 million research articles and 3.9 million US patents, we find a substantial impact advantage of teamwork over solo work. However, this advantage declines as differences between the team members’ individual citation indices grow. Team impact is predicted more by the lower-citation rather than the higher-citation team members, typically centering near the harmonic average of the individual citation indices. Consistent with this finding, teams tend to assemble among individuals with similar citation impact in all fields of science and patenting. In assessing individuals, our index, which accounts for each coauthor, is shown to have substantial advantages over existing measures. First, it more accurately predicts out-of-sample paper and patent outcomes. Second, it more accurately characterizes which scholars are elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

This arrangement involves hierarchies in which consultants are full residual claimants of output and compensate producers via incentive contracts.

The euroization of bank deposits in Eastern Europe,2014,[],Martin Brown; Helmut Stix,Martin Brown; Helmut Stix,https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiu002,"In Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe a substantial share of bank deposits are denominated in foreign currency. Deposit euroization poses key challenges for monetary policy and financial sector supervision. On the one hand, it limits the effectiveness of monetary policy interventions. On the other hand, it increases financial sector fragility by exposing banks to currency risk or currency-induced credit risk. Policymakers disagree on whether countries in the region should tackle deposit euroization with ‘dedollarization’ policies or should rather strive to adopt the Euro as their legal tender. Assessing the potential effectiveness of ‘dedollarization’ policies requires a clear understanding of which households hold foreign currency deposits and why they do so. On the basis of survey data covering 16,375 households in ten countries in 2011 and 2012, we provide a comprehensive household-level analysis of deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. We examine how households’ preferences for, and holding of, foreign currency deposits are related to individual expectations about monetary conditions and network effects. We also examine to what extent monetary expectations and deposit euroization are the legacy of past financial crises or the outflow of current policies and institutions in the region. Our findings suggest that deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe can be partly tackled by prudent monetary and economic decisions by today’s policymakers. The preferences of households for Euro deposits are partly driven by their distrust in the stability of their domestic currency, which in turn is related to their assessment of current policies and institutions. However, our findings also suggest that a stable monetary policy may not be sufficient to deal with the hysteresis of deposit euroization across the region. First, we confirm that the holding of foreign currency deposits has become a ‘habit’ in the region. Second, we find that deposit euroization is still strongly influenced by households’ experiences of financial crises in the 1990s. Our findings question the effectiveness of supply side interventions (e.g. bank regulation) or demand side interventions (e.g. local currency capital market development) in de-euroizing household savings. First, we show that deposit euroization is largely demand driven.

Specifically, we investigate this in the context of two state-wide ballot measures in Virginia that provided property tax relief intended to aid seniors and disabled veterans. Using residential MLS microdata from Virginia, results from a regression discontinuity analysis show that once the 2010 tax relief measures passed on Election Day, property values rose sharply in response to the sudden increase in demand for homeownership among the targeted groups. As part of our identification strategy, we find that “senior preferred” housing as well as areas with higher proportions of seniors and veterans experienced the highest price appreciation, while areas with fewer veterans or seniors saw little impact. Further, we explore numerous alternative hypotheses and specifications that might explain this discontinuity. The findings suggest that this type of policy provides an immediate benefit to current homeowners, thereby offsetting benefits for subsequent homeowners within the targeted groups. This effect represents an unintended consequence of targeted property tax relief as a (very popular) policy tool more generally, as an immediate capitalization into home prices subsequently increases the cost of housing for many individuals the relief was intended to help.",Bureau of Economic Analysis; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Longwood University,"Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA); University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - Dept. of Public Policy; Longwood University","Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA); University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - Dept. of Public Policy; Longwood University","bea, microdata, bureau","Capitalization, Property tax, Property (philosophy), Business, Monetary economics, Economics, Tax reform, Public economics, Philosophy, Epistemology, Linguistics"

For example, mergers are only observed leading to price increases after the relaxation of antitrust standards in the mid-1980s; price increases following mergers are persistent but tend to become smaller over time; and, there is evidence that firms target plants charging below average prices for acquisition. Finally, I use a simple multinomial logit demand model to assess the effects of merger activity on total welfare.

In order to accommodate substantial heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) across agents and markets, the article first develops a general framework for estimating and solving dynamic discrete choice models in continuous time that is computationally light and readily applicable to dynamic games. In the proposed framework, players face a standard dynamic discrete choice problem at decision times that occur stochastically. The resulting stochastic-sequential structure naturally admits the use of conditional choice probability methods for estimation and makes it possible to compute counterfactual simulations for relatively high-dimensional games. The model and method are applied to the retail grocery industry, into which Walmart began rapidly expanding in the early 1990s, eventually attaining a dominant position. We find that Walmart's expansion into groceries came mostly at the expense of the large incumbent supermarket chains, rather than the single-store outlets that bore the brunt of its earlier conquest of the broader general merchandise sector. Instead, we find that independent grocers actually thrive when Walmart enters, leading to an overall reduction in market concentration.

Chilean Pension Reform: Coverage Facts and Policy Alternatives,2006,[],Solange Berstein; Guillermo. Larra amp iacute n; Francisco López del Pino,Solange. Berstein; Guillermo. Larra&amp;iacute;n; Francisco. Pino,https://doi.org/10.1353/eco.2006.0000,"Chilean Pension Reform: Coverage Facts and Policy Alternatives Solange Berstein Guillermo Larraín Francisco Pino [Comments] The Chilean pension reform has given rise to significant debate in the last decade. It was the first pension system in which the core mechanism for producing pensions is individual capitalization and the first to hand over its management to the private sector. This pension concept is one of the rare institutions exported from Chile to the rest of the world, including countries in Latin America, central and eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia, as well as a few developed countries such as Sweden. A quarter of a century after its inception, it seems natural to undertake a deep evaluation of the system's outcomes, strengths, and weaknesses. Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel make a positive macroeconomic assessment, as well as good evaluation on financial grounds based on the high average return on assets.1 Several papers, however, argue that the level of competition is weak, which translates into high prices and high returns on equity.2 From a public finance perspective, Arenas suggests that the fiscal burden may be significant and increasing, while the average coverage ratio appears to be low.3 Finally, in an earlier paper, we undertake a preliminary evaluation of coverage based on affiliates' administrative data.4 These last two [End Page 227] studies reveal that one of the main weaknesses of the Chilean model is its low coverage.5 This paper studies the reasons behind the low coverage of the Chilean pension system by focusing on one benefit—namely, old-age pensions. It departs from previous studies in that it uses individual data from administrative records, as well as socioeconomic characterization of these same individuals provided by the 2002 Social Security Survey (EPS), to project the future benefits of the generations that are now contributing to the system.6 The use of individual data is relevant because it takes into account the large heterogeneity of individual experiences. We use these data to simulate the distribution of old-age benefits, which is a key aspect of a defined-contributions environment. A defined-contributions system has no solvency problems, as there are few, if any, guarantees involved. Beyond the rate of return on investments, however, the final pension depends heavily on the amount, number, and timing of contributions. In a defined-benefits system, shocks affect the solvency of the system, whereas in a defined-contributions system, individuals bear much of the risk regarding the amount of the final pension.7 In fact, while the theoretical replacement rates are high for those who contribute throughout their working lives, they may be quite low for workers with infrequent contributions.8 The use of individual-level data allows us to identify some of the risks that generate such uncertainty in Chile's private pension system. When the Chilean system was designed, it was expected to deliver replacement rates of around 75 percent.9 This is the case for around one-third of affiliates. However, the strong heterogeneity of individual income and contribution density profiles means that some people will be in a very difficult situation [End Page 228] when they retire.10 Self-employed workers (who are not mandated to contribute in Chile) and women (who have a relatively low participation rate) appear to make up the most vulnerable categories. Additionally, a considerable segment of the population shifts between salaried work and self-employment and between formal and informal employment. Even if they work most of their active life, such workers may end up with low contribution densities. Con­sequently, the average contribution density in the case of the Chilean pension system hides very different realities that should be considered when evaluating the system's performance.

Business dynamics of innovating firms: Linking U.S. patents with administrative data on workers and firms,2018,[],Stuart J.H. Graham; Cheryl Grim; Tariqul Islam; Alan C.

We match granted patents between 2000 and 2011 to administrative databases of firms and workers housed at the U.S. Census Bureau. We use inventor information in addition to the patent assignee firm name to improve on previous efforts linking patents to firms. The triangulated database allows us to maximize match rates and provide validation for a large fraction of matches. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms. Although manufacturing firms are more likely to patent than firms in other sectors, we find that most patenting firms are in the services and wholesale sectors.

Go West Young Firm: The Impact of Startup Migration on the Performance of Migrants,2023,[],Jorge Guzmán,Jorge Guzman,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4924,"This paper studies how regional migration to tech clusters impacts the performance of startups within the United States. Startups that move to Silicon Valley experience a significant improvement in performance. This improvement is higher than migrations to other regions in the United States, many of which report null treatment effects. The startups that benefit the most from migration are those leaving low performing entrepreneurial ecosystems and moving to high performing ecosystems, consistent with an agglomeration mechanism. Within different measures of the ecosystem, the level of local patenting predicts startup improvements more than venture capital or the quality-adjusted number of startups, suggesting the local innovation environment is more important to migrant performance than financing or the presence of other startup peers.

Passive Versus Active Growth: Evidence from Founder Choices and Venture Capital Investment,2019,[],Christian Catalini; Jorge Guzmán; Scott Stern,Christian Catalini; Jorge Guzman; Scott Stern,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26073,"This paper develops a novel approach for assessing the role of passive learning versus a proactive growth orientation in the entrepreneurial growth process.We develop a simple model linking early-stage founder choices, venture capital investment and skewed growth outcomes such as the achievement of an IPO or significant acquisition.Using comprehensive business registration data from 34 US states from 1995-2004, we observe that firms that register in Delaware or obtain intellectual property such as a patent or trademark are far more likely to ultimately realize significant equity growth, and these choices also predict early-stage venture capital investment.Moreover, the estimated probability of receiving venture capital as reflected in early-stage founder choices predicts growth even for firms that do not receive venture capital.We use these findings to estimate bounds on the fraction of proactive versus passive firms among firms that ultimately achieve significant equity growth.While nearly half of all firms that achieve modest equity growth (> $10M) are consistent with passive learning (as they neither make early-stage founder choices nor receive venture capital), 78% of firms experiencing an equity growth event greater than $100M are associated with active founder choices and/or venture capital investment, and these firms are concentrated in geographic hubs such as Silicon Valley.Finally, our approach offers a novel approach for estimating the private returns to venture capital, matching on founder choices rather than demographics; consistent with prior studies, venture-backed firms are approximately 5X more likely to grow, with heterogeneity across location and time period.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Brandeis University,"MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-480 Cambridge, MA 02142; Brandeis University, Wharton School of Management, Michigan University, Kellogg School of Management, and Columbia Business School.; Columbia Business School Uris Hall, 711 116th St & Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142","MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-480 Cambridge, MA 02142; Brandeis University, Wharton School of Management, Michigan University, Kellogg School of Management, and Columbia Business School.; Columbia Business School Uris Hall, 711 116th St & Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Venture capital, Investment (military), Economics, Initial public offering, Social venture capital, Finance, Business, Monetary economics, Political science, Politics, Law"
Business Dynamic Statistics of Innovative Firms,2017,[],Nathan Goldschlag; Elisabeth Ruth Perlman,Nathan Goldschlag; Elisabeth Perlman,,"A key driver of economic growth is the reallocation of resources from low to high productivity activities. Innovation plays an important role in this regard by introducing new products, services, and business methods that ultimately lead to increased productivity and rising living standards. Traditional measures of innovation, particularly those based on aggregate inputs, are increasingly unable to capture the breadth and depth of innovation in modern economies. In this paper, we describe an effort at the US Census Bureau, the Business Dynamics Statistics of Innovative Firms (BDS-IF) project, which aims to address these challenges by extending the Business Dynamics Statistics data to include new measures of innovative activity. The BDS-IF project will produce measures of firm, establishment, and employment flows by firm age, firm size, and industry for the subset of firms engaged in activities related to innovation. These activities include patenting and trademarking, the employment of STEM workers, and R&D expenditures. The exibility of the underlying data infrastructure allows this measurement agenda to be extended to include copyright activity, management practices, and high growth firms.",,,,"census bureau, bureau","Productivity, Business, Census, Industrial organization, Business cycle, Marketing, Economics, Economic growth, Population, Demography, Sociology, Keynesian economics"

Comparing Public Housing and Housing Voucher Tenants with Bayesian Propensity Scores,2012,[],Brent D. Mast,Brent D. Mast,,"AbstractThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) currently has no administrative data to compare housing quality of public housing units with that of Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) units. The American Housing Survey (AHS) provides the only data available to compare subjective housing and neighborhood quality assessments in HUD's largest rental assistance programs.Quality comparisons based on AHS data are problematic because the AHS overrepresents public housing and underrepresents the HCVP.HUD administrative data, however, are an excellent source of prior information for the expected proportion of households in public housing. In this study, I explore Bayesian methods using prior information on variables such as income and rents to estimate propensity scores for program participation. I then use the Bayesian propensity scores to improve the reliability of AHS-based quality comparisons. Results indicate that, after adjusting for program participation propensities, little difference exists in AHS household and neighborhood quality ratings between public housing and voucher households.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)IntroductionToday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides rental assistance to about 1 million households in public housing (PH) projects and about 2.1 million households through the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP). *·2 PH units are owned and operated by public housing agencies (PHAs). In sharp contrast, the HCVP provides subsidizes to low-income households to seek safe and sanitary privately owned rental units.Numerous arguments are made for providing rental assistance in privately owned buildings instead of providing PH. The primary motivation for increasing private-sector housing choices has been expanding social and economic opportunities for low-income households receiving rental assistance. Another argument is that private owners might have better incentives for operational efficiency, thus lowering program costs.An argument against private-sector choices is that private landlords may have more incentive to control costs by reducing housing quality. To ensure all HCVP units meet a minimum-quality threshold, HUD requires compliance with Housing Quality Standards regulations. PHAs must preinspect units before tenants occupy a unit and PHAs enter into assistance contracts. Annual reinspections are also required for all units. Samples of units must be selected for quality control inspections, and PHAs and landlords must ensure that housing- quality problems are promptly rectified.Measuring living conditions of assisted households is integral to evaluating the performance of HUD rental assistance programs. Currently, HUD has no administrative data to compare the housing quality of PH units with that of HCVP units.In addition to providing quality housing, HUD rental assistance programs are also intended to promote access to good neighborhoods. Geocoding of HUD administrative records allows for comparison of census measures of neighborhood quality such as median income, poverty rates, and minority concentration. Buron and Pantrabansh (2007), however, report that census measures do not correlate well with HCVP households' subjective opinions of their neighborhoods.The American Housing Survey (AHS) data are the only data available for comparing both subjective housing quality assessments and subjective neighborhood quality assessments in HUD's largest rental assistance programs. Quality comparisons based on AHS data are problematic because the AHS overrepresents PH and underrepresents the HCVP. The 2009 sum of weights was about 1.65 million households for either program. Apparently, many AHS HCVP tenants respond that they are PH tenants (Casey, 1992; HUD, 2008; Rucinski and Athey, 1995; Shroder, 2002).In 2011, the Census Bureau began using HUD administrative data to sample renters known to receive rental assistance through various HUD programs. …",,,,"census bureau, bureau","Voucher, Public housing, Economic rent, Rental housing, Renting, Business, Quality (philosophy), Public economics, Actuarial science, Economics, Demographic economics, Economic growth, Engineering, Accounting, Philosophy, Civil engineering, Epistemology, Microeconomics"

Information disclosure and the market for acquiring technology companies,2020,[],George Chondrakis; Carlos J. Serrano; Rosemarie Ham Ziedonis,George Chondrakis; Carlos J. Serrano; Rosemarie H. Ziedonis,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3260,"Abstract Research Summary The market for acquiring technology companies is rife with information frictions. Although such frictions can stifle trading activity, they also provide room for strategic gain. We investigate this dual role of information frictions by exploiting an institutional reform that releases technological information to the public domain. Leveraging cross‐sectoral variation in the magnitude of disclosure, we find an increase in acquisition activity and in the technological distance between matched pairings. In line with predictions from strategic factor market theory, however, we also find a disproportionate decline in acquirer returns on average. Our findings suggest that information disclosed through the reform‐facilitated exchange in the takeover market yet had a leveling effect on the returns to acquirers. Managerial Summary Firms acquire technology‐oriented companies to complement internal R&amp;D projects and accelerate the innovation process. But identifying promising targets is challenging, not least due to the lack of information about the value of acquired technologies. This study investigates an information shock and tests its effects on the market for acquiring technology‐intensive companies. We find that greater disclosure of technological information to the public domain intensifies trading activity and allows acquirers to better identify and assess targets outside their core technological domains. But it also reduces the returns to acquirers. In combination, our findings illuminate a dual role of information disclosure: placing more information into the public domain may facilitate trade in corporate takeover markets while simultaneously restricting acquirer opportunities for strategic gain.",Boston University; Universitat Ramon Llull; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University; National Bureau of Economic Research; UPF Barcelona School of Management,"Universitat Ramon Llull, ESADE, Sant Cugat, Barcelona, Spain; Boston University, Questrom School of Business, &amp; National Bureau of Economic Research Boston Massachusetts USA; Department of Economics and Business Universitat Pompeu Fabra, &amp; UPF Barcelona School of Management, &amp; Barcelona GSE Barcelona Spain; Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, & UPF Barcelona School of Management, & Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain","Universitat Ramon Llull, ESADE, Sant Cugat, Barcelona, Spain; Boston University, Questrom School of Business, &amp; National Bureau of Economic Research Boston Massachusetts USA; Department of Economics and Business Universitat Pompeu Fabra, &amp; UPF Barcelona School of Management, &amp; Barcelona GSE Barcelona Spain; Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, & UPF Barcelona School of Management, & Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Business, Industrial organization, Dual (grammatical number), Shock (circulatory), Value (mathematics), Information technology, Marketing, Medicine, Art, Literature, Machine learning, Computer science, Political science, Internal medicine, Law"

Rural–urban migration of Alaska Indigenous peoples: changing patterns and drivers,2024,[],Matthew Berman; Ruoqing Wang-Cendejas,Matthew Berman; Ruoqing Wang-Cendejas,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00168-024-01298-7,"Abstract Migration from rural areas to urban population centers has long been associated with modernization; a pattern one might expect to accelerate as advancing climate change degrades rural land-based livelihoods. Does rural–urban migration of arctic Indigenous peoples follow a similar pattern? Has depopulation of rural arctic areas accelerated as climate-driven environmental change has intensified in the rapidly warming arctic? What are the main drivers of mobility, both historically and more recently? We address these questions through a review and synthesis of empirical studies of rural–urban migration of arctic Indigenous peoples using individual records over the past four decades, along with analysis of new data informed by those previous studies. The use of microdata allows us to incorporate variation in individual situations and choices as well as community characteristics that vary across space and time, permitting us to make inferences about factors associated with decisions to move. The evidence shows that rural–urban migration patterns appear largely to have persisted over the decades, but some drivers have changed. Living costs appear to have replaced livelihood opportunities as the dominant driver since 2000. Other changes in decisions to move are complex, and require additional research to understand.",Providence College; Office of Inspector General; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, 3211 Providence Drive, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA; Office of the Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs, 351 E Temple St., Suite B510, Los Angeles, CA, 90012, USA","Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, 3211 Providence Drive, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA; Office of the Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs, 351 E Temple St., Suite B510, Los Angeles, CA, 90012, USA","irs, microdata","Indigenous, Livelihood, Geography, Arctic, Climate change, Urbanization, Microdata (statistics), Population, Modernization theory, Rural area, Socioeconomics, Economic growth, Environmental planning, Economic geography, Census, Political science, Agriculture, Ecology, Sociology, Economics, Demography, Archaeology, Law, Biology"

Kaplan; Josh Lerner,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2010.00272.x,"This article presents a selective history of the U.S. venture capital (VC) industry, a discussion of the current state of the market, and some predictions about where the market is going. There is no doubt that the U.S. venture capital industry has been very successful. The VC model has provided an efficient solution to a difficult problem—that of enabling people with promising ideas but often limited track records to raise capital from outside investors. A large fraction of IPOs, including many of the most successful, have been funded by venture capitalists, and the U.S. VC model has been copied around the world. Armed with this historical perspective, the authors view with skepticism the recent claims that the VC model is broken. In the past, VC investments in companies have represented a remarkably constant 0.15% of the total value of the stock market; and commitments to VC funds, while more variable, have been consistently in the 0.10% to 0.20% range. Both of these percentages have continued to hold in recent years. And despite the relatively low number of IPOs, the returns to VC funds this decade have largely maintained their historical relationship to the overall stock market. To be sure, VC investment and returns continue to be subject to boom‐and‐bust cycles. But if the recent period has most of the features of a bust, the authors view today's historically low level of commitments to U.S. VC funds as a fairly reliable indicator of relatively high expected returns for the 2009 and (probably) 2010 vintage years. Perhaps the most promising future role for venture capital, as the authors suggest in closing, is to increase the productivity of the corporate research and development function through various kinds of partnerships and outsourcing arrangements.",National Bureau of Economic Research; World Economic Forum; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,"Jacob H.

Fire in the belly? Employee motives and innovative performance in start‐ups versus established firms,2017,[],Henry Sauermann,Henry Sauermann,https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.1267,"Research Summary: We examine whether start‐ups attract employees with different pecuniary and non‐pecuniary motives than small or large established firms. We then explore whether such differences in employee motives may lead to differences in innovative performance across firm types. Using data on more than 10,000 U.S. R&amp;D employees, we find that start‐up employees (“joiners”) place lower importance on job security and salary but greater importance on independence and responsibility. Start‐up employees have higher patent output than employees in small and large established firms, and this difference is partly mediated by employee motives—especially joiners’ greater willingness to bear risk. We discuss implications for research as well as for managers and policy makers concerned with the supply of human capital to entrepreneurship and innovation. Managerial Summary: Start‐ups and established firms play different roles in the economy and differ with respect to their organizational features. Recent research has started to also explore differences in their human capital. While prior work focuses on employees’ skills and experience, we broaden the notion of human capital to include motivational characteristics. We find that start‐up employees differ from those working in established firms with respect to their motives, most notably a weaker concern with job security. Moreover, such differences can partly explain higher innovative performance in start‐ups. Our findings suggest that founders may derive significant benefits from hiring “joiners” with entrepreneurial motives.

Residential Segregation in Japan: Ethnic Stratification in a Global New Destination,2024,[],Liang Hao,Hao Liang,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/beh43,"This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",Cornell University,Cornell University,Cornell University,"restricted, microdata","Stratification (seeds), Ethnic group, Economic geography, Geography, Regional science, Political science, Seed dormancy, Botany, Germination, Dormancy, Law, Biology"

Once firms pass this productivity threshold, they all export. However, empirical evidence indicates that a substantial share of highly productive top-performing firms does not export. In this paper, we focus specifically on this group of high-performing non-exporters and identify the factors that prevent them from successfully exporting. We employ a large Dutch administrative dataset containing both small and large firms in services and manufacturing for the period 2010–2016. Our main findings are two-fold. First, controlling for high productivity identifies other factors that need to be fulfilled for exporting firms. Firm size, import status, and foreign ownership are important determinants of a firm’s future export activity. Second, firm location is crucial. A location in more peripheral areas increases the probability that high-productive firms do not export, whereas a location close to the border increases export probabilities.",Uppsala University; University of Groningen; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis,"Faculty of Economics & Business (FE&B), University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Economics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Netherlands’ Bureau for Economics Policy Analysis (CPB), The Hague, Netherlands","Faculty of Economics & Business (FE&B), University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Economics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Netherlands’ Bureau for Economics Policy Analysis (CPB), The Hague, Netherlands","irs, bureau","Productivity, Business, Industrial organization, Export performance, International trade, Foreign ownership, Economics, Manufacturing, International economics, Monetary economics, Foreign direct investment, Marketing, Macroeconomics"

We develop and quantify a spatial model of a city with heterogeneous agents and non-homothetic preferences for neighborhoods with endogenous amenity quality. As the rich get richer, demand increases for the high quality amenities available in downtown neighborhoods. Rising demand drives up house prices and spurs the development of higher quality neighborhoods downtown. This gentrification of downtowns makes poor incumbents worse off, as they are either displaced to the suburbs or pay higher rents for amenities that they do not value as much. We quantify the corresponding impact on well-being inequality. Through the lens of the quantified model, the change in the income distribution between 1990 and 2014 led to neighborhood change and spatial resorting within urban areas that increased the welfare of richer households relative to that of poorer households, above and beyond rising nominal income inequality.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; University of Chicago; University of Pennsylvania","University of Pennsylvania The Wharton School; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California–Berkeley.; University of California–Berkeley Department of Economics","University of Pennsylvania The Wharton School; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California–Berkeley.; University of California–Berkeley Department of Economics","national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Sorting, Geography, Economic geography, Economics, Mathematics, Algorithm"

Misperceptions About the Magnitude and Timing of Changes in American Income Inequality,2009,[],Robert J. Gordon,Robert Gordon,https://doi.org/10.3386/w15351,"The rise in American inequality has been exaggerated both in magnitude and timing.Commentators lament the large gap between the growth rates of real median household income and of private sector productivity.This paper shows that a conceptually consistent measure of this growth gap over 1979 to 2007 is only one-tenth of the conventional measure.Further, the timing of the rise of inequality is often misunderstood.By some measures inequality stopped growing after 2000 and by others inequality has not grown since 1993.This cessation of inequality's secular rise in 2000 is evident from the growth of Census mean vs. median income, and in the income share of the top one percent of the income distribution.The income share of the 91st to 95th percentile has not increased since 1983, and the income ratio of the 90th to 10th percentile has barely increased since 1986.Further, despite a transient decline in labor's income share in 2000-06, by mid-2009 labor's share had returned virtually to the same value as in 1983, 1991, and 2001.Recent contributions in the inequality literature have raised questions about previous research on skill-biased technical change and the managerial power of CEOs.Directly supporting our theme of prior exaggeration of the rise of inequality is new research showing that price indexes for the poor rise more slowly than for the rich, causing most empirical measures of inequality to overstate the growth of real income of the rich vs. the poor.Further, as much as two-thirds of the post-1980 increase in the college wage premium disappears when allowance is made for the faster rise in the cost of living in cities where the college educated congregate and for the lower quality of housing in those cities.A continuing tendency for life expectancy to increase faster among the rich than among the poor reflects the joint impact of education on both economic and health outcomes, some of which are driven by the behavioral choices of the less educated.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"Department of Economics Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208-2600 and NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208-2600 and NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Economics, Economic inequality, Inequality, Income distribution, Income inequality metrics, Percentile, Demographic economics, Median income, Labour economics, Population, Demography, Sociology, Statistics, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics"

Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class—adults between the median and the 90th percentile—has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality.

Sullivan,Bruce Meyer; James Sullivan,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23655,"Official income inequality statistics indicate a sharp rise in inequality over the past five decades.These statistics do not accurately reflect inequality because income is poorly measured, particularly in the tails of the distribution, and current income differs from permanent income, failing to capture the consumption paid for through borrowing and dissaving and the consumption of durables such as houses and cars.Such limitations suggest that consumption inequality would more accurately reflect inequality in economic well-being.Highly cited recent work concludes that the rise in consumption inequality mirrors, or even exceeds, the rise in income inequality.We revisit this finding, constructing improved measures of consumption, focusing on its wellmeasured components that are reported at a high and stable rate relative to national accounts.While overall income inequality (as measured by the 90/10 ratio) rose over the past five decades, the rise in overall consumption inequality was small.The patterns for the two measures differ by decade, and they moved in opposite directions after 2006.Income inequality rose in both the top and bottom halves of the distribution, but increases in consumption inequality are only evident in the top half.We show that our results are robust to several different approaches, including one that accounts for measurement error using a demand system.Previous work that concluded that consumption inequality rises at least as much as income inequality is sensitive to how consumption is measured; excluding small, poorly measured components of consumption yields results very similar to ours.The declining quality of income data is likely an important reason for the differences between income and consumption at the very bottom.Asset price changes likely account for some of the differences between the measures in recent years for the top half of the distribution.",Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Chicago; University of Notre Dame; National Tax Association; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Society of Labor Economics joint meetings, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,; Department of Economics 3108 Jenkins Nanovic Halls University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, IN 46556 James.X.; Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 E 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; University of Wisconsin, Iowa St. University, MIT, National Tax Association Spring Symposium, Peking University, Stanford University,","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Society of Labor Economics joint meetings, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,; Department of Economics 3108 Jenkins Nanovic Halls University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, IN 46556 James.X.; Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 E 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; University of Wisconsin, Iowa St. University, MIT, National Tax Association Spring Symposium, Peking University, Stanford University,","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Inequality, Consumption (sociology), Economic inequality, Economics, Mathematics, Sociology, Social science, Mathematical analysis"

For businessto-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and interchangeable product items.

We also examine the composition of income after claiming and find that both Social Security benefits and non-Social Security retirement distributions typically represent substantial shares of income. Examining the five-year period from one year before individuals first receive Social Security retirement benefits to three years after, 81 percent of individuals had income, either directly or through a spouse, from employer retirement plans, annuities, or IRAs; and another 8 percent had a Form 1099-R (indicating a retirement account transaction, such as a rollover, that did not generate income), a Form 5498 (indicating IRA ownership), or both. This study uses the SOI 1999 Edited Panel of individual income tax returns, with information through tax year 2010, supplemented with data from information returns. We structure the data to follow individual taxpayers—specifically, individuals who were the primary or secondary taxpayer on a joint return or the primary taxpayer on a non-joint return in 1999—rather than tax returns. Information returns and various schedules filed with Form 1040 allow us to allocate labor income, Social Security benefits, and retirement income (pension, annuity, and IRA distributions) to primary and secondary filers on joint returns. Information returns also allow us to measure the income of all 1999 taxpayers through 2010 regardless of whether they filed a tax return in a subsequent year or not. We focus on working individuals age 55 to 61 in 1999 who did not receive Social Security benefits in 1999.

First, overall retirement plan participation was stable or rising through 2007, though overall participation fell noticeably in the wake of the Great Recession and has remained lower. Second, cohort-based analysis of life-cycle trajectories shows that participation in retirement plans is strongly correlated with income, and that the recent decline in participation is concentrated among younger and low-to middle-income families. Third, the shift in the type of pension coverage from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) occurred within—not just across—income groups. Fourth, retirement wealth is less concentrated than nonretirement wealth, so the growth of retirement wealth relative to nonretirement wealth helped offset the increasing concentration in nonretirement wealth. Fifth, the shift from DB to DC had only a modest effect in the other direction because DC wealth is more concentrated than DB wealth.",Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Federal Reserve,"Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System","Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System","irs, federal reserve","Inequality, Economics, Demographic economics, Labour economics, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis"

What Do We Really Know about Offshoring? Industries and Countries in Global Production Sharing,2017,[],Gordon Hanson,Gordon H. Hanson,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2980947,"Theories of offshoring model how firms divide production stages across borders. Empirical work on the phenomenon has long been hampered by a paucity of cross-country data on specialization within industries. In standard trade sources, we observe flows of goods between countries at the product level, but not the specific tasks that countries perform in manufacturing these products. The literature has consequently developed an inventive arsenal of indirect measures of industry fragmentation. In this paper, I turn to data on trade in assembly services ― a labor-intensive task that typically occurs at the end of the production chain ― to document which industries and countries are engaged in this common form of global production sharing. Trade in assembly services is prominent in just a handful of sectors, including apparel, electronics, footwear, furniture, toys, and transportation equipment. Data for the United States ― prior to the post-1980 growth in trade with developing countries ― reveal that most offshoring industries are relatively intensive in the employment of very low-wage labor, exhibit relatively wide variation in the wages paid to their employees, and use capital relatively unintensively. These industries tend to be less likely to hire workers in occupations that are intensive in routine tasks. Offshoring thus appears to be most prominent in sectors for which firms have a strong incentive to divide production between high-wage and low-wage countries and in which the automation of routinized jobs offer few opportunities to reduce labor intensity. Countries that specialize in manufacturing tend to cycle through offshoring industries as they accumulate capital, starting out in apparel, footwear, and toys and later moving into electronics and electrical machinery. These industry dynamics are most pronounced in labor-abundant East Asia. They are not present in the resource-abundant countries that specialize in primary commodities.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, San Diego","University of California, San Diego (UCSD) - Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies (IRPS); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)","University of California, San Diego (UCSD) - Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies (IRPS); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)","national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Offshoring, Business, Wage, Production (economics), Labour economics, Developing country, Product (mathematics), Industrial organization, Outsourcing, Economics, Marketing, Economic growth, Geometry, Mathematics, Macroeconomics"

In each stage, a final-good producer contracts with a distinct supplier for the procurement of a customized stage-specific component. Our model yields a sharp characterization for the optimal allocation of ownership rights along the value chain. We show that the incentive to integrate suppliers varies systematically with the relative position (upstream versus downstream) at which the supplier enters the production line. Furthermore, the nature of the relationship between integration and downstreamness depends crucially on the elasticity of demand faced by the final-good producer. Our model readily accommodates various sources of asymmetry across final-good producers and across suppliers within a production line, and we show how it can be taken to the data with international trade statistics. Combining data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade database and estimates of U.S. import demand elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006), we find empirical evidence broadly supportive of our key predictions.

The paper classifies firms into four ordinal categories: Not Credit Constrained, Maybe Credit Constrained, Partially Credit Constrained, and Fully Credit Constrained to understand the characteristics of the firms that fall into each group. Comparable data from the Enterprise Surveys for 116 countries are used to look at the relationship between firm size and credit-constrained status. First, the analysis finds that small and medium enterprises are more likely to be credit constrained (either partially or fully) than large firms. Furthermore, small and medium enterprises finance their working capital and investments mainly through trade credit and informal sources of finance. These two results hold to a large extent in all the regions of the developing world. Second, although size is a significant predictor of the probability of being credit constrained, firm age is not. Third, high-performing firms, as measured by labor productivity, are less likely to be credit constrained. This result applies to all firms but is not as strong for small firms as it is for large and medium firms. Finally, in countries with high private credit-to-gross domestic product ratios, firms are less likely to be credit constrained. Given the importance of access to credit for firm growth and efficiency, this paper confirms that throughout the developing world access to credit is inversely related to firm size but positively related to productivity and financial deepening in the country.

With increasing inequality, those at the bottom of the distribution now face relatively worse economic conditions, but newborn health among the most disadvantaged has actually improved. The most likely explanation is increasing knowledge about determinants of infant health and how to protect it along with public policies that put this knowledge into practice.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Brown University,"National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; Department of Economics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.; Department of Economics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; Department of Economics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.; Department of Economics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Disadvantage, Disadvantaged, Inequality, Health equity, Public health, Health care, Maternal health, Environmental health, Medicine, Demographic economics, Economic growth, Economics, Health services, Political science, Population, Nursing, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Law"

Fletcher,Joanna Venator; Jason Fletcher,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22263,"Abstract In this paper, we estimate the impacts of abortion clinic closures on access to clinics in terms of distance and congestion, abortion rates, and birth rates. Between 2010 and 2017, Wisconsin passed three laws regulating abortion providers and two of five abortion clinics closed in Wisconsin, increasing the distance to the nearest clinic to 55 miles on average and to over 100 miles in the most affected counties. We use a difference‐in‐differences design to estimate the effect of changes in travel distance on births and abortions, using within‐county variation across time in distance to identify the effect. We find that a 100‐mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic is associated with 30.7 percent fewer abortions and 3.2 percent more births. We see no significant effect of increased congestion at remaining clinics on abortion rates. Interacting the legislative changes with distance, we find that the effects of distance on abortion are approximately 1.33 time stronger in the presence of laws requiring multiple physician visits to obtain an abortion. Our results suggest that even small numbers of clinic closures can result in significant restrictions to abortion access of similar magnitude to those seen in Texas where a greater number of clinics ceased operations.",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin–Madison,"University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Economics 1180 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706-1393; University of Wisconsin-Madison La Follette School of Public Affairs 1225 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Economics 1180 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706-1393; University of Wisconsin-Madison La Follette School of Public Affairs 1225 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","irs, national bureau of economic research, bureau","Abortion, Medicine, Demography, Family planning, Pregnancy, Population, Research methodology, Environmental health, Sociology, Genetics, Biology"

Identifying Causal Effects of Reproductive Health Improvements on Women's Economic Empowerment Through the Population Poverty Research Initiative,2018,[],Jocelyn E. Finlay; Marlene A. Lee,JOCELYN E. FINLAY; MARLENE A. LEE,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12326,"Policy Points: Improvements in reproductive health lead to improvements in women's economic empowerment. Contraceptive use improves women's agency, education, and labor force participation; higher maternal age at first birth (reducing adolescent childbearing) increases the likelihood of school completion and participation in the formal labor market; and having fewer children increases labor market participation. Reproductive health is not just a benefit to a woman's individual rights, but her gateway for breaking free from her poverty trap and improving the welfare of herself, her children, and her household. Context Women's access to employment, business opportunities, and financial resources is critical to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals over the next 15 years. With increased attention to women's economic empowerment among donors and policymakers across the globe, this moment is a pivotal one in which to review the current state of the research on this topic. Methods We reviewed the Population and Poverty (PopPov) Research Initiative results from the past 10 years with attention to the causal link between reproductive health improvements and women's economic empowerment, in addition to seminal research that informed our understanding of the link. Findings Our review of PopPov findings revealed that improvements in reproductive health do lead to improvements in women's economic empowerment; expanding contraceptive use improves women's agency, education, and labor force participation; higher maternal age at first birth (reducing adolescent childbearing) increases the likelihood of school completion and participation in the formal labor market; and having fewer children increases labor force participation. Conclusions Gaps remain in measuring women's work and in the full exploration of women's economic empowerment. More research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of reproductive health improvements on women's economic empowerment, as some studies have shown that at times unintended negative consequences occur after early positive improvements.",Harvard University; Population Reference Bureau,Harvard T.H.

"The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations",2017,[],Francine D. Blau; Lawrence M. Kahn,Francine D. Blau; Lawrence M. Kahn,https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.20160995,"Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980–2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.

Children and the Remaining Gender Gaps in the Labor Market,2023,[],Patricia Cortés; Jessica Pan,Patricia Cortés; Jessica Pan,https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.20221549,"The past five decades have seen a remarkable convergence in the economic roles of men and women in society. Yet, persistently large gender gaps in terms of labor supply, earnings, and representation in top jobs remain. Moreover, in countries like the United States, convergence in labor market outcomes appears to have slowed in recent decades. In this article, we focus on the role of children and show that many potential explanations for the remaining gender disparities in labor market outcomes are related to the fact that children impose significantly larger penalties on the career trajectories of women relative to men. We document that, in the United States, more than two-thirds of the overall gender earnings gap can be accounted for by the differential impacts of children on women and men. We propose a simple model of household decision-making to motivate the link between children and gender gaps in the labor market, and to help rationalize how various factors potentially interact with parenthood to produce differential outcomes by gender. We discuss several forces that might make the road to gender equity even more challenging for modern cohorts of parents, and offer a critical discussion of public policies that seek to address the remaining gaps.

In the short-term, pill access caused declines in fertility and increases in both the share of children born with low birthweight and the share born to poor households. In the long-term, access led to negligible changes in fertility while increasing the share of children with college-educated mothers and decreasing the share with divorced mothers. The short-term effects appear to be driven by upwardly-mobile women opting out of early childbearing while the long-term effects appear to be driven by a retiming of births to later ages. These effects differ from those of abortion legalization, although we find suggestive evidence that pill diffusion lowered abortions. Our results suggest that abortion and the pill are on average used for different purposes by different women, but on the margin some women substitute from abortion towards the pill when both are available.

The model of household specialization and division of labor introduced by Becker posits that when forming households, couples will exploit the gains from trade by having one spouse specialize in market work while the other specializes in household work. Given the historical advantage of men in the labor market, the model predicts specialization by gender and therefore an earnings advantage for married men and an earnings disadvantage for married women. Is this model of specialization useful for understanding the evolution of the gender gap across generations of women. And what about children? Academic papers have shown that wages of mothers are significantly lower than those of non-mothers with similar human capital characteristics.

Chatterji,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3077,"Abstract Research Summary Scholars have traditionally characterized the variation in firm performance as determined by conditions after entry, where the entry decision is a one‐shot binary choice determined by cost–benefit analysis. However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre‐entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre‐entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre‐entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process. Managerial Summary We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend.

Organization Theory and Methodology,1998,[],Michael C. Jensen,Michael C. Jensen,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.94036,"The foundations are being put in place for a revolution in the science of organizations. Some major analytical building blocks for the development of a theory of organizations are outlined and discussed in this paper. This development of organization theory will be hastened by increased understanding of the importance of the choice of definitions, tautologies, analytical techniques, and types of evidence. The two literatures of agency theory are briefly discussed in light of these issues. Because accounting is an integral part of the structure of every organization, the development of a theory of organizations will be closely associated with the development of a theory of accounting. This theory will explain why organizations take the form they do, why they behave as they do, and why accounting practices take the form they do. Because such positive theories as these are required for purposeful decision making, their development will provide a better scientific basis for the decisions of managers, standard-setting boards, and government regulatory bodies.",College of Accounting; National Bureau of Economic Research; European Corporate Governance Institute; Harvard University,Harvard University - Accounting & Control Unit; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); Harvard Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Harvard University - Accounting & Control Unit; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); Harvard Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),"national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Agency (philosophy), Development (topology), Development theory, Management science, Government (linguistics), Organizational theory, Business, Engineering ethics, Sociology, Management, Economics, Engineering, Social science, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis, Linguistics, Philosophy, Market economy"

We examine this issue using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component with Administrative Records (MEPS-ICAR), a unique employer-employee linked data set that is constructed by matching the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to Internal Revenue Service administrative records and the Decennial Census. Multivariate analyses show that among firms with fewer than 50 workers, the probability that workers receive an insurance offer is positively associated with higher median workforce incomes, and conditional offers of dependent coverage increase when the majority of workers are married or from a family with at least three members. This first application of the MEPS-ICAR highlights the significance of workforce characteristics in shaping small employer insurance benefits and the data’s usefulness for expanding analyses of policy changes, wage-benefit tradeoffs, and health insurance benefits.",United States Census Bureau; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD, USA; United States Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD, USA; United States Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA","internal revenue service, irs, census bureau, bureau","Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Workforce, Business, Census, Actuarial science, Wage, Panel data, Revenue, Health insurance, Labour economics, Health care, Economics, Finance, Environmental health, Medicine, Economic growth, Population, Econometrics"
Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Premium Cost Growth and Its Association With Earnings Inequality Among US Families,2024,[],Kurt Hager; Ezekiel Emanuel; Dariush Mozaffarian,Kurt Hager; Ezekiel Emanuel; Dariush Mozaffarian,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.51644,"Importance Costs of employer-sponsored health care benefits have increased faster than workers’ wages for several decades, with important implications for disparities in earnings and wage stagnation. Objective To quantify how growth in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) premiums may have been associated with reduced annual wages, disparities in earnings by race and ethnicity and wage level, and wage stagnation among US families with ESI. Design, Setting, and Participants In this economic evaluation, serial cross-sectional analyses were performed of US families receiving ESI from 1988 to 2019 based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Kaiser Employer Health Benefits Survey, US Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, and federal payroll taxation rates. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 2022 to July 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures Percentage of annual compensation associated with health care premiums (after accounting for tax deductibility) and lost wages associated with growth in cost of premiums from 1989 to 2019 based on 1988 compensation. To assess disparities, analyses were stratified by race and ethnicity and wage level. Results In 1988, 44.7 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 43.3 [13.1] years; 30.1% were female; and 2.4% identified as Asian, 6.2% as Hispanic, 8.6% as non-Hispanic Black, and 82.8% as non-Hispanic White) were covered by ESI family plans; this number remained similar in 2019 at 44.8 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 47.1 [12.9] years; 41.3% were female; and 1.3% identified as Asian, 9.9% as Hispanic, 9.9% as non-Hispanic Black, and 78.9% as non-Hispanic White). In 1988, the mean (SD) household size was 3.3 (1.3) people, and in 2019, it was 3.4 (1.3) people. If ESI costs had remained at the same proportion of the 1988 average compensation package, then in 2019, the median US family with ESI could have earned $8774 (95% CI, $8354-$9195) more in annual wages. During all 32 years, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation were greater for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic families than for non-Hispanic White families. By 2019, 13.8% (95% CI, 13.5%-14.1%) of compensation among non-Hispanic White families with ESI went to premium costs compared with 19.2% (95% CI, 18.8%-19.7%) among non-Hispanic Black families and 19.8% (19.3%-20.3%) among Hispanic families with ESI. In 2019, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation at the 95th percentile of earnings for families with ESI were 3.9% (95% CI, 3.8%-4.0%) compared with 28.5% (95% CI, 27.8%-29.2%) at the 20th percentile of earnings. From 1988 to 2019, the mean cumulative lost earnings associated with growth in health care premiums for the median US family with ESI was $125 340 (95% CI, $120 155-$130 525) in 2019 dollars, 4.7% of earnings over the 32-year period. Conclusions and Relevance This economic evaluation of US families receiving ESI suggests that 3 decades of increasing health care premiums were likely associated with reduced annual earnings and increased earnings inequality by race and ethnicity and wage level and were meaningfully associated with wage stagnation.",Tufts Medical Center; Tufts University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School,"Food Is Medicine Institute, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Division of Cardiology, Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia","Food Is Medicine Institute, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Division of Cardiology, Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia","census bureau, bureau","Earnings, Wage, Payroll, Demographic economics, Health care, Census, Population, Ethnic group, Demography, Health and Retirement Study, Economics, Medicine, Labour economics, Gerontology, Environmental health, Political science, Economic growth, Finance, Accounting, Sociology, Law"

Our research represents the first econometric analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) COBRA subsidy and contributes to a better understanding of consumer responses to government-subsidized private health insurance and discussions surrounding Affordable Care Act (ACA) policies. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the subsidy is associated with a substantial increase in own-name employer coverage among the targeted group. We estimate a −0.38 to −0.27 price elasticity of demand for health insurance, depending on the specification. This suggests that consumers are somewhat more price sensitive than previously thought, although there are caveats to generalizing from past settings to individuals affected by ACA subsidies.

First, in explicitly recognizing how optimizing behavior, particularly in the form of residential sorting, can lead to nonrandom assignment of pollution, economists have employed a wide range of quasi-experimental techniques to develop causal estimates of the effect of pollution. Second, economic research has placed a considerable focus on the role of avoidance behavior, which is an important component for understanding the difference between biological and behavioral effects of pollution and for proper welfare calculations. Lastly, economic research has expanded the focus of analysis beyond traditional health outcomes to include measures of human capital, including labor supply, productivity, and cognition. Our review of the quasi-experimental evidence on this topic suggests that pollution does indeed have a wide range of effects on individual well-being, even at levels well below current regulatory standards. Given the importance of health and human capital as an engine for economic growth, these findings underscore the role of environmental conditions as an important factor of production.

Tracking firms over time, we find that as a CEO ages, the firm experiences lower investment, lower sales growth, and lower profitability, but also higher probability of survival, suggesting a trade‐off between the managerial approaches of younger and older CEOs. These results are stronger in industries more reliant on human capital, such as service and creative industries. Our evidence also suggests that regional financial development moderates the relationship between a CEO's age and a firm's performance by facilitating the reallocation of assets from firms owned by older CEOs to firms owned by younger CEOs. Managerial Summary How do management styles change as CEOs grow older? Using a large firm‐level dataset, we examine the behavior and performance of firms with CEOs of different ages. We find that as a CEO grows older, firm investment, growth, and profitability decline, but probability of survival increases. The results are stronger in industries where human capital and creativity are more important.

The paper describes simple mechanisms that give rise to Pareto distributions for income and wealth and considers the economic forces that influence top inequality over time and across countries. For example, it is in this context that the role of the famous r – g expression is best understood.",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"STANFORD U; Charles I.

Nonparametric Counterfactual Predictions in Neoclassical Models of International Trade,2017,[],Rodrigo Adão; Arnaud Costinot; Dave Donaldson,Rodrigo Adao; Arnaud Costinot; Dave Donaldson,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150956,"We develop a methodology to construct nonparametric counterfactual predictions, free of functional form restrictions on preferences and technology, in neoclassical models of international trade. First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach.

Recent Declines in Labor's Share in US Income: A Preliminary Neoclassical Account,2015,[],Robert Lawrence,Robert Lawrence,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21296,"As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson the elasticity of substitution ( σ) is a key parameter that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes.Establishing the magnitude of σ is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it.Several papers have explained the recent decline in labor's share in income by claiming that σ is greater than one and that there has been capital deepening.This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims.It shows that despite a rise in measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the US has been sufficiently rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980.In combination with estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that σ is less than 1, these declines in the effective capital ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor's share in US income at both the aggregate and industry level.Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital formation would raise labor's share in income.",National Bureau of Economic Research; John F.

Lack of Selection and Limits to Delegation: Firm Dynamics in Developing Countries,2020,[],Ufuk Akcigit; Harun Alp; Michael Peters,Ufuk Akcigit; Harun Alp; Michael Peters,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20180555,"Delegating managerial tasks is essential for firm growth. Most firms in developing countries, however, do not hire outside managers but instead rely on family members. In this paper, we ask if this lack of managerial delegation can explain why firms in poor countries are small and whether it has important aggregate consequences. We construct a model of firm growth where entrepreneurs have a fixed time endowment to run their daily operations. As firms grow large, the need to hire outside managers increases. Firms’ willingness to expand therefore depends on the ease with which delegation can take place. We calibrate the model to plant-level data from the United States and India. We identify the key parameters of our theory by targeting the experimental evidence on the effect of managerial practices on firm performance from Bloom et al. (2013). We find that inefficiencies in the delegation environment account for 11 percent of the income per capita difference between the United States and India. They also contribute to the small size of Indian producers, but would cause substantially more harm for US firms. The reason is that US firms are larger on average and managerial delegation is especially valuable for large firms, thus making delegation efficiency and other factors affecting firm growth complements.

Impacts of incoming knowledge on product innovation: technology transfer in auto-related industries in developing economies,2012,[],Tomohiro Machikita; Yasushi Ueki,Tomohiro Machikita; Yasushi Ueki,https://doi.org/10.1080/19761597.2012.683948,"This paper studies two questions on the role of networked sources of knowledge influential to product innovation. First, what is the extent of technology transferred through vertical linkages and public–private alliances, including university–industry linkages, in the phase of product improvement and development? Second, what types of knowledge are transferred from external technology sources? In a sample of ASEAN firms' self-reported partner data restricted to automotive-related industries, we found that direct linkages with multinational corporation (MNC) customers in foreign countries resulted in a lower propensity of product innovation. Indeed, incoming knowledge from MNC customers relating to the management of quality of existing products especially explained the lower propensity of product innovation. We also found that production linkages with MNC suppliers in foreign countries resulted in a higher propensity of product innovation. Incoming knowledge from MNC suppliers about quality controls explained a lower propensity of product innovation. These findings empirically indicate that networked sources of knowledge have a significant influence trade-off between maintaining existing operations and developing new products.

We find that deregulation and consolidation are associated with a 10 percent increase in operating performance, achieved primarily by reducing the duration of reactor outages.

Stimulated by these developments, there has been rapid progress in data and methods for measuring GVC linkages. The macro approach to measuring GVCs connects national input–output tables across borders by using bilateral trade data to construct global input–output tables. These tables have been applied to measure trade in value added, the length of and location of producers in GVCs, and price linkages across countries. The micro approach uses firm-level data to document firms’ input sourcing decisions, how import and export participation are linked, and how multinational firms organize their production networks.

Multinational Firms and International Business Cycle Transmission*,2016,[],Javier Cravino; Andrei A. Levchenko,Javier Cravino; Andrei A.

We use these data to document two novel empirical patterns. First, foreign affiliate and headquarter sales exhibit strong positive comovement: a 10% growth in the sales of the headquarter is associated with a 2% growth in the sales of the affiliate. Second, shocks to the source country account for a significant fraction of the variation in sales growth at the source-destination level. We propose a parsimonious quantitative model to interpret these findings and to evaluate the role of multinational firms for international business cycle transmission. For the typical country, the impact of foreign shocks transmitted by all foreign multinationals combined is non-negligible, accounting for about 10% of aggregate productivity shocks. On the other hand, since bilateral multinational production shares are small, interdependence between most individual country pairs is minimal. Our results do reveal substantial heterogeneity in the strength of this mechanism, with the most integrated countries significantly more affected by foreign shocks.",Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,"1University of Michigan and NBER; 2University of Michigan NBER and CEPR, Michigan","1University of Michigan and NBER; 2University of Michigan NBER and CEPR, Michigan","cepr, irs, nber","Multinational corporation, Business, Productivity, Business cycle, Monetary economics, International business, International trade, Industrial organization, Economics, Macroeconomics, Finance, Management"

Does Foreign Direct Investment Increase the Productivity of Domestic Firms?

Despite this being hugely important to public policy choices, there is little conclusive evidence indicating that domestic firms benefit from foreign presence in their sector. It is possible, though, that researchers have been looking for foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers in the wrong place. Multinationals have an incentive to prevent information leakage that would enhance the performance of their local competitors in the same industry but at the same time may want to transfer knowledge to their local suppliers in other sectors. Spillovers from FDI may be, therefore, more likely to take place through backward linkages—that is, contacts between domestic suppliers of intermediate inputs and their multinational clients—and thus would not have been captured by the earlier literature. This paper focuses on the understudied issue of FDI spillovers through backward linkages and goes beyond existing studies by shedding some light on factors driving this phenomenon. It also improves over existing literature by addressing several econometric problems that may have biased the results of earlier research. Based on a firm-level panel data set from Lithuania, the estimation results are consistent with the existence of productivity spillovers. They suggest that a 10 percent increase in the foreign presence in downstream sectors is associated with 0.38 percent rise in output of each domestic firm in the supplying industry. The data indicate that these spillovers are not restricted geographically, since local firms seem to benefit from the operation of downstream foreign affiliates on their own, as well as in other regions. The results further show that greater productivity benefits are associated with domestic-market, rather than export-oriented, foreign affiliates. But no difference is detected between the effects of fully-owned foreign firms and those with joint domestic and foreign ownership. The findings of a positive correlation between productivity growth of domestic firms and the increase in multinational presence in downstream sectors should not, however, be interpreted as a call for subsidizing FDI. These results are consistent with the existence of knowledge spillovers from foreign affiliates to their local suppliers, but they may also be a result of increased competition in upstream sectors. While the former case would call for offering FDI incentive packages, it would not be the optimal policy in the latter. Certainly more research is needed to disentangle these two effects. This paper—a product of Trade, Development Research Group—is part of a larger effort in the group to study the contribution of trade and foreign direct investment to technology transfer.

Data-driven anatomy of hierarchical migration patterns in the United States,2024,[],Xurui Yan; Haoying Han; Xing Su; Chao Fan,Xurui Yan; Haoying Han; Xing Su; Chao Fan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103825,"Population migration has become a dominant force in shaping local demographic changes in the United States, surpassing natural growth rates. However, whether the migration pattern and the influential factor have distinctive disparities between hierarchical county pairs is still elusive. This study delves into the spatial diversity and driving forces behind migration patterns at the county level, with a particular focus on the disparities through an examination of migration levels and scales. We utilize county-pair-level migration data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to unveil the intricate network structure of population movement. Our findings reveal a pronounced spatial diversity in migration patterns, while cities witness a net influx of population, and in contrast to rural areas, majority of population inflow of cities primarily stems from metro areas. We employ Hierarchical Linear Models to analyze the impact of social connectedness, local wealthiness, and racial diversity on migration flows. The results highlight that cities with robust social networks, higher economic status, and balanced racial diversity are more attractive to migrants. Notably, the influence of racial diversity differences between origin and destination counties is found to be more significant in attracting migration compared to per capita income disparities. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in managing demographic changes and addressing the challenges associated with migration-driven population redistribution.

Although rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally, rugged terrain within Africa afforded protection to those being raided during the slave trades. Since the slave trades retarded subsequent economic development, ruggedness within Africa has also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa's unique geographic environment, and it is fully accounted for by the history of the slave trades.",Bread for the World Institute; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies; Harvard University,"IMDEA Social Sciences Institute and CEPR; Harvard University, NBER, and BREAD","IMDEA Social Sciences Institute and CEPR; Harvard University, NBER, and BREAD","cepr, nber","Blessing, Terrain, Differential (mechanical device), Geography, Economic geography, Development economics, Economics, Cartography, Archaeology, Engineering, Aerospace engineering"

Younger democracies are more corrupt; exhibit less rule of law, lower levels of bureaucratic quality and secondary school enrollment, and more restrictions on the media; and spend more on public investment and government workers. This pattern is exactly consistent with the predictions of Keefer and Vlaicu (n.d.) . The inability of political competitors to make credible promises to citizens leads them to prefer clientelist policies: to underprovide nontargeted goods, to overprovide targeted transfers to narrow groups of voters, and to engage in excessive rent seeking.

A growing body of new empirical work focuses on the measurement and estimation of the effects of historical variables on contemporary income by explicitly taking into account the ancestral composition of current populations. The evidence suggests that economic development is affected by traits that have been transmitted across generations over the very long run. This article surveys this new literature and provides a framework to discuss different channels through which intergenerationally transmitted characteristics may impact economic development, biologically (via genetic or epigenetic transmission) and culturally (via behavioral or symbolic transmission). An important issue is whether historically transmitted traits have affected development through their direct impact on productivity, or have operated indirectly as barriers to the diffusion of productivity-enhancing innovations across populations.

AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, nevertheless was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more-educated, more-experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common alongside indicators of high-growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth-oriented business strategies. Early adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of ""superstar"" cities and emerging hubs led startups' adoption of AI.

This risk is exacerbated when firms produce for low volume internal use, and is mitigated for those firms that sell to larger markets. Hence, products characterized by higher rates of technological change will be more likely to be produced by mass specialized firms to which other firms outsource production.

The findings suggest that, among knowledge spillovers, the creation of human capital via education of students has a larger impact than the circulation of research knowledge. Moreover, the two factors seem to be complements rather than substitutes.

When an inventor moves to a city with a large cluster of inventors in the same field, she experiences a sizable increase in the number and quality of patents produced.

Relying on the exogenous assignment of office space to the hub’s 251 start-ups, we find that proximity positively influences knowledge spillovers as proxied by the likelihood of adopting an upstream web technology already used by a peer start-up. This effect is largest for start-ups within close proximity of each other and quickly decays; start-ups more than 20 meters apart on the same floor are indistinguishable from start-ups on different floors. The main driver of the effect appears to be social interactions. Although start-ups in close proximity are most likely to participate in social coworking space events together, knowledge spillovers are greatest between start-ups that socialize but are dissimilar. Ultimately, start-ups that are embedded in environments that have neither too much nor too little diversity perform better but only if they socialize.

Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.

Stock,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.32.4.53,"Most countries, including the United States, have an array of greenhouse gas mitigation policies, which provide subsidies or restrictions typically aimed at specific technologies or sectors. Such climate policies range from automobile fuel economy standards, to gasoline taxes, to mandating that a certain amount of electricity in a state comes from renewables, to subsidizing solar and wind electrical generation, to mandates requiring the blending of biofuels into the surface transportation fuel supply, to supply-side restrictions on fossil fuel extraction. This paper reviews the costs of various technologies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our aim is twofold. First, we seek to provide an up-to-date summary of costs of actions that can be taken now using currently available technology. These costs focus on expenditures and emissions reductions over the life of a project compared to some business-as-usual benchmark—for example, replacing coal-fired electricity generation with wind, or weatherizing a home. We refer to these costs as static because they are costs over the life of a specific project undertaken now, and they ignore spillovers. Our second aim is to distinguish between dynamic and static costs and to argue that some actions taken today with seemingly high static costs can have low dynamic costs, and vice versa. We make this argument at a general level and through two case studies, of solar panels and of electric vehicles, technologies whose costs have fallen sharply. Under the right circumstances, dynamic effects will offer a justification for policies that have high costs according to a myopic calculation.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; Harvard University,"James H.

Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.",Institute for Fiscal Studies; Paris School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Chicago; Collège de France; University College London,"College de France and London School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich and CEPR; University College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Chicago, CEPR and NBER","College de France and London School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich and CEPR; University College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Chicago, CEPR and NBER","cepr, nber","Economics, Inequality, Causality (physics), Economic inequality, Instrumental variable, Panel data, Social mobility, Income inequality metrics, Income distribution, Demographic economics, Variable (mathematics), Econometrics, Labour economics, Sociology, Mathematics, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Mathematical analysis, Social science"
Ten Facts on Declining Business Dynamism and Lessons from Endogenous Growth Theory,2020,[],Ufuk Akcigit; Sina Ates,Ufuk Akcigit; Sina T. Ates,https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.20180449,"In this paper, we review the literature on declining business dynamism and its implications in the United States and propose a unifying theory to analyze the symptoms and the potential causes of this decline. We first highlight 10 pronounced stylized facts related to declining business dynamism documented in the literature and discuss some of the existing attempts to explain them. We then describe a theoretical framework of endogenous markups, innovation, and competition that can potentially speak to all of these facts jointly. We next explore some theoretical predictions of this framework, which are shaped by two interacting forces: a composition effect that determines the market concentration and an incentive effect that determines how firms respond to a given concentration in the economy. The results highlight that a decline in knowledge diffusion between frontier and laggard firms could be a significant driver of empirical trends observed in the data. This study emphasizes the potential of growth theory for the analysis of factors behind declining business dynamism and the need for further investigation in this direction.

What Happened to US Business Dynamism?,2023,[],Ufuk Akcigit; Sina Ates,Ufuk Akcigit; Sina T. Ates,https://doi.org/10.1086/724289,"We attempt to understand potential common forces behind rising market concentration and a slowdown in business dynamism in the US economy, through a micro-founded general equilibrium model of endogenous firm dynamics. The model captures the strategic behavior between competing firms, its effect on their innovation decisions, and the resulting ""best-versus-the-rest"" dynamics. We consider multiple potential mechanisms that can drive the observed changes and use the calibrated model to assess their relative importance, with particular attention to the implied transitional dynamics. Our results highlight the dominant role of a decline in the intensity of knowledge diffusion from frontier firms to laggard ones.

Credit Supply and the Price of Housing,2015,[],Giovanni Favara; Jean Imbs,Giovanni Favara; Jean Imbs,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20121416,"An exogenous expansion in mortgage credit has significant effects on house prices. This finding is established using US branching deregulations between 1994 and 2005 as instruments for credit. Credit increases for deregulated banks, but not in placebo samples. Such differential responses rule out demand-based explanations, and identify an exogenous credit supply shock. Because of geographic diver-sification, treated banks expand credit: housing demand increases, house prices rise, but to a lesser extent in areas with elastic housing supply, where the housing stock increases instead. In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation.

Seeking the Roots of Entrepreneurship: Insights from Behavioral Economics,2014,[],Thomas B. Åstebro; Holger Herz; Ramana Nanda; Roberto A. Weber,Thomas Åstebro; Holger Herz; Ramana Nanda; Roberto A. Weber,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.28.3.49,"There is a growing body of evidence that many entrepreneurs seem to enter and persist in entrepreneurship despite earning low risk-adjusted returns. This has lead to attempts to provide explanations—using both standard economic theory and behavioral economics— for why certain individuals may be attracted to such an apparently unprofitable activity. Drawing on research in behavioral economics, in the sections that follow, we review three sets of possible interpretations for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in, entrepreneurship. Differences in risk aversion provide a plausible and intuitive interpretation of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, a growing literature has begun to highlight the potential importance of overconfidence in driving entrepreneurial outcomes. Such a mechanism may appear at face value to work like a lower level of risk aversion, but there are clear conceptual differences—in particular, overconfidence likely arises from behavioral biases and misperceptions of probability distributions. Finally, nonpecuniary taste-based factors may be important in motivating both the decisions to enter into and to persist in entrepreneurship.",HEC Paris; University of Zurich; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship, HEC Paris, Paris, France.; Professor of Economics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Associate Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts, and a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; A senior research associate position in Microeconomics and Experimental Economic Research, University of Zurich.

A differences‐test strategy shows that firms operating newly pledgeable assets significantly increased their borrowing following the reform. Small, young, and financially constrained businesses benefitted the most, observing improved credit access and real‐side outcomes. Start‐ups emerged with higher “at‐inception” leverage, located farther from large cities, with more assets‐in‐place than before. Their exit and bankruptcy rates declined. Spatial analyses show that the reform reached firms in rural areas, reducing credit access inequality across France's countryside.",University of Hong Kong; Cornell University,"Cornell University - The Johnson School; Kevin Aretz is at Alliance Manchester Business School.

These aggregate indicators are based on hundreds of specific and disaggregated individual variables measuring various dimensions of governance, taken from 35 data sources provided by 33 different organizations. The data reflect the views on governance of public sector, private sector and NGO experts, as well as thousands of citizen and firm survey respondents worldwide. The authors also explicitly report the margins of error accompanying each country estimate. These reflect the inherent difficulties in measuring governance using any kind of data. They find that even after taking margins of error into account, the WGI permit meaningful cross-country comparisons as well as monitoring progress over time. The aggregate indicators, together with the disaggregated underlying indicators, are available at www.govindicators.org.

Estimates of the Trade and Welfare Effects of NAFTA,2014,[],Lorenzo Caliendo; Fernando Parro,L. Caliendo; F.

We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada, and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input–output linkages.

The Dynamics of Comparative Advantage,2015,[],Gordon Hanson; Nelson Lind; Marc-Andreas Muendler,Gordon Hanson; Nelson Lind; Marc-Andreas Muendler,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21753,"This paper characterizes the dynamic empirical properties of country export capabilities in order to inform modelling of the long-run behavior of comparative advantage.The starting point for our analysis is two strong empirical regularities in international trade that have previously been studied incompletely and in isolation to one another.The literature has noted a tendency for countries to concentrate exports in a few sectors.We show that this concentration arises from a heavy-tailed distribution of industry export capabilities that is approximately log normal and whose shape is stable across countries, sectors, and time.Likewise, previous research has detected a tendency for mean reversion in national industry productivities.We establish that mean reversion in export capability, rather than indicative of convergence in productivities or degeneracy in comparative advantage, is instead consistent with a well behaved stochastic growth process that delivers a stationary distribution of country export advantage.In literature on the growth of cities and firms, economists have used stochastic processes to study the determinants of the long-run size distributions.Our contribution is to develop an analogous empirical framework for identifying the parameters that govern the stationary distribution of export capability.The main result of this analysis is that a generalized gamma distribution, which nests many commonly studied distributions, provides a tight fit of the data but log normality offers a reasonable approximation.Importantly, the stochastic process that generates log normality can be estimated in its discretized form by simple linear regression.Log linearity allows for an extension of our approach to multivariate diffusions, in which one can permit innovations to productivity to be transmitted intersectorally and internationally, as in recent models of trade and growth.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, San Diego","0519 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093-0519 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics, 0508 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093-0508; NBER ITI, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Brown, Univ.

Gravity and Comparative Advantage: Estimation of Trade Elasticities for the Agricultural Sector,2018,[],Kari E.R. Heerman; Ian M. Sheldon,Kari E.R. Heerman; Ian Sheldon,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24772,"In this paper, a structural gravity model is presented which features intra-sector heterogeneity in agricultural productivity systematically linked to land and climate characteristics.The ""systematic heterogeneity"" (SH) gravity model predicts that countries with similar land and climate characteristics tend to specialize in the same agricultural products.Agricultural trade flow elasticities then depend on comparative advantage, with larger-magnitude trade flow responses predicted among countries more likely to specialize in similar agricultural products and thus compete head-to-head in foreign markets.This is in contrast to standard log-linear gravity models, which impose a restrictive pattern of trade flow elasticities that depend only on absolute advantage in the agricultural sector.We also show how the SH gravity model can accommodate product-specific trade costs.This allows the model to analyze changes in the dispersion of trade costs across products.Such analysis cannot be carried out in a standard gravity model, in which trade costs are assumed constant.Our results confirm economically and statistically significant heterogeneity in the effects of the variables that typically proxy for trade costs in gravity models and demonstrate that the SH gravity model is able to overcome the limitations imposed by the restrictive pattern of elasticities in a standard gravity model.",National Bureau of Economic Research; The Ohio State University,"1400 Independence Ave., SW, Mail Stop 1800 Washington, DC 20250; Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Dev Ohio State University Columbus, OH 43210; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 24772","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Dev Ohio State University Columbus, OH 43210; 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Mail Stop 1800 Washington, DC 20250; NBER Working Paper No. 24772","national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Economics, Gravity model of trade, Agriculture, Comparative advantage, Estimation, Econometrics, Agricultural economics, Environmental science, International economics, International trade, Ecology, Biology, Management"

Estimating a binary choice model of firm behavior, we find significant evidence for the idea that barriers to entry induce persistence in lobbying. The existence of these costs is further confirmed in studying how firms responded to a particular policy change: the expiration of legislation relating to the H-1B visa. Due to its influence on firm behavior, we argue that this persistence fundamentally changes the environment in which legislation is made.

"Cutting the Innovation Engine: How Federal Funding Shocks Affect University Patenting, Entrepreneurship, and Publications",2023,[],Tania Babina; Alex Xi He; Sabrina T Howell; Elisabeth Ruth Perlman; Joseph Staudt,Tania Babina; Alex Xi He; Sabrina T Howell; Elisabeth Ruth Perlman; Joseph Staudt,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac046,"Abstract This article studies how federal funding affects the innovation outputs of university researchers. We link person-level research grants from 22 universities to patents, publications, and career outcomes from the U.S. Census Bureau. We focus on the effects of large, idiosyncratic, and temporary cuts to federal funding in a researcher’s preexisting narrow field of study. Using an event study design, we document that these negative federal funding shocks reduce high-tech entrepreneurship and publications but increase patenting. The lost publications tend to be higher quality and more basic, whereas the additional patents tend to be lower quality, less general, and more often privately assigned. These federal funding cuts lead to an increase in private funding, which partially compensates for the decline in federal funding. Together with evidence from industry-university contracts, the results suggest that federal funding cuts shift university research funding from federal to private sources and lead to innovation outputs that are less openly accessible and more often appropriated by corporate funders.","National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; University of Maryland, College Park; United States Census Bureau","New York University and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of Maryland , United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States; Columbia University , United States","New York University and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of Maryland , United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States; Columbia University , United States","national bureau of economic research, census bureau, bureau","Entrepreneurship, Quality (philosophy), Census, Federal funds, Business, Political science, Accounting, Economics, Finance, Sociology, Monetary policy, Monetary economics, Population, Philosophy, Demography, Epistemology"

It provides an expanded view of the world economy for 148 countries with chapters focusing on world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links as well as introductions highlighting recent research on major development issues. This edition includes some key indicators for 1999. This report aims to make statistics lively and comprehensive-to paint a picture of the world and its people. The numbers in this book tell the reader that people in most places are living longer, but that in countries gripped by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, life expectancies are declining. Average incomes continue to rise for most developing countries, but some of the poorest have slipped backwards, subjecting millions more to extreme poverty. It can also be seen that the developing countries are becoming more important participants in the global economy. But the picture is flawed because too often the data are incomplete or unreliable or entirely unavailable. Recognizing the many flaws in the statistical system and the need to address them directly by improving the capacity of countries to produce statistics, a consortium of more than 90 countries and international organizations has come together and pledged to increase the resources for statistical capacity building in developing countries. Hence future editions of this report may prove even more useful.

Yet at the same time, there have been long-held concerns that many university-based discoveries never realize their potential social benefits. Looking across universities, research and commercialization activities such as start-up formation vary tremendously – variation that could reflect the composition and orientation of faculty research, university-level factors such as patenting and licensing efforts, or broader place-based factors such as location in a technology cluster. We take a first step towards unpacking this heterogeneity in university commercialization by analyzing how the propensity of academic research to spill over to commercial innovation changes when academics move across universities. Our estimates suggest that at least 15–25% of geographic variation in commercial spillovers from university-based research is attributable to place-specific factors.",Dartmouth Hospital; National Bureau of Economic Research; Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Harvard University; Dartmouth College,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Harvard Business School - Finance Unit; Independent; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Harvard Business School - Finance Unit; Independent; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College,"irs, nber, national bureau of economic research, bureau","Commercialization, Unpacking, Variation (astronomy), Economic geography, Regional science, Political science, Sociology, Marketing, Business, Geography, Linguistics, Philosophy, Physics, Astrophysics"

Academics and practitioners have effectively articulated the strengths of the venture model. At the same time, venture capital financing also has real limitations in its ability to advance substantial technological change. Three issues are particularly concerning to us: 1) the very narrow band of technological innovations that fit the requirements of institutional venture capital investors; 2) the relatively small number of venture capital investors who hold and shape the direction of a substantial fraction of capital that is deployed into financing radical technological change; and 3) the relaxation in recent years of the intense emphasis on corporate governance by venture capital firms. While our ability to assess the social welfare impact of venture capital remains nascent, we hope that this article will stimulate discussion of and research into these questions.",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ramana Nanda is Sarofim-Rock Professor, both at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts.

This study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking. The study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding. Except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, and—as with most digital business models—scalability was identified as a key criterion. Additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs. Through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors. We also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration.",Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,"Chair of Technology Management, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 90762 Fürth, Germany","Chair of Technology Management, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 90762 Fürth, Germany","irs, nber","Entrepreneurial finance, Entrepreneurship, FinTech, Equity (law), Finance, Business, Business model, Debt, Financial innovation, Marketing, Financial services, Economics, Political science, Law"

Donating the Voucher: An Alternative Tax Treatment of Private School Enrollment,2013,[],Andrew Samwick,Andrew A. Samwick,https://doi.org/10.1086/671246,"Approximately 10% of school-age children in the United States are enrolled in private schools, relieving the financial burden on public school systems, and the taxpayers who support them, of the cost of their education. At present, the tax code does not allow families who provide this financial relief an income tax deduction, even though such relief is a gift to governments for exclusively public purposes and thus is analogous to a charitable donation. Using the Public Use Microdata Sample of the American Community Survey and the NBER Internet Taxsim calculator, this paper estimates that granting families who enroll their children in private schools an income tax deduction equal to the per-pupil expenditures in their public school district would cost the federal government an average of $7.75 billion per year over the 2006–10 period. This amount is less than 1% of federal income tax revenues. Because private school enrollment, public school expenditures, the likelihood of itemization, and marginal tax rates increase with taxpayer income, the dollar benefits of this change are positively related to income. At the margin, high-income taxpayers would receive about 35 cents in federal and state tax relief for each dollar of per-pupil expenditures forgone.",Dartmouth Hospital; Dartmouth College,Dartmouth College and NBER,Dartmouth College and NBER,"nber, microdata","Voucher, Public economics, Private school, Business, Economics, Demographic economics, Accounting"
Aggregate Advertising Expenditure in the U.S. Economy: What's Up? Is It Real?,2020,[],Alvin J. Silk; Ernst R. Berndt,Alvin Silk; Ernst Berndt,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28161,"The two components of the advertising industry -the creative sector that develops and produces messages, and the communications sector that transmits messages via various media -have each been greatly affected by advances in creative design and communications technologies.As the media composition of advertising has changed in the last century for both local and national advertising -from newspapers, outdoor and radio advertising to network and cable television, and most recently to internet and digital media -so too has been transformed the very concept of advertising, its functionality and its measurement.We compare four sources of annual nominal U.S. aggregate advertising expenditure data -from the public sector Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Service Industries, and the private sector McCann Erickson and Magna Global advertising agencies-that are available over various time periods.In nominal terms, we estimate the elasticity of advertising expenditures with respect to Gross Domestic Product, and find that this elasticity appears to have increased substantially beginning in the late 1990s -from about 1.4 to 1.9.The timing of this structural break coincides roughly with the decline of print, radio and network and cable television, and the dramatic increase in digital and internet-based advertising.To understand the forces underlying this structural break in nominal advertising expenditures, data on media-specific advertising prices are needed, thereby converting nominal to real advertising.However, currently annual U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index data on digital and many other advertising media prices are only available beginning in 2010.The availability of media-specific quality-constant price indexes would not only enable researchers to trace more completely the recent impact of digital and internet advertising, but would also facilitate contemporary and longstanding issues to be addressed surrounding the measurement of advertising effects, including how variations in the durability of response to advertising across media are related to inter-media price differentials, and why heterogeneity among firms and industries may arise with respect to the procyclicality of advertising policies.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Graduate School of Business Administration Harvard University Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-533 Cambridge, MA 02142","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Graduate School of Business Administration Harvard University Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-533 Cambridge, MA 02142","internal revenue service, national bureau of economic research, census bureau, bureau","Aggregate (composite), Aggregate expenditure, Economics, Advertising, Monetary economics, Economy, Keynesian economics, Business, Materials science, Composite material"

Health Effects of Economic Crises,2016,[],Christopher J. Ruhm,Christopher J. Ruhm,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3373,"Abstract This analysis summarizes prior research and uses national, US state and county‐level data from 1976 to 2013 to examine whether the mortality effects of economic crises differ in kind from those of the more typical fluctuations. The tentative conclusion is that economic crises affect mortality rates (and presumably other measures of health) in the same way as less severe downturns – leading to improvements in physical health. The effects of severe national recessions in the USA appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality that is roughly twice as strong as that predicted by the elevated unemployment rates alone, while the higher predicted rate of suicides during typical periods of economic weakness is approximately offset during severe recessions. No consistent pattern is obtained for more localized economic crises occurring at the state level – some estimates suggest larger protective mortality effects while others indicate offsetting deleterious consequences.

Continuity or change? How the onset of COVID‐19 affected internal migration in Australia,2022,[],Francisco Perales; Aude Bernard,Francisco Perales; Aude Bernard,https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2626,"Despite anecdotal evidence of a COVID-19 induced decline in the intensity of interstate migration in Australia, population-level evidence is limited. The recent release of the 2020 wave of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey provides a unique opportunity to robustly assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level, direction, determinants, and reasons for migration in Australia. By applying a series of regression models to individual-level longitudinal microdata, and measuring migration at a range of spatial scales, this paper shows that COVID-19 has somewhat accelerated the long-term decline in the intensity of internal migration-particularly for residential mobility, short-distance migration, and migration due to employment and involuntary reasons. The socio-demographic determinants of migration have remained broadly stable, despite a slight increase in the deterring effect of duration of residence and a reduction in the impact of education. Finally, we show that the increase in net migration gains in regional areas is underpinned by a decrease in outflows.

The size of the executive team—the group of managers reporting directly to the CEO—doubled during this period. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in functional managers rather than general managers, a phenomenon we term “functional centralization.” Using panel data on senior management positions, we show that changes in the structure of the executive team are tightly linked to changes in firm diversification and information technology investments. These relationships depend crucially on the function involved; those closer to the product (“product” functions, e.g., marketing and R&amp;D) behave differently from functions further from the product (“administrative” functions, e.g., finance, law, and human resources). We argue that this distinction is driven by differences in the information-processing activities associated with each function and apply this insight to refine and extend existing theories of centralization.

Exploiting the rapid diffusion of the internet in the United States, we assess the sensitivity of production chain organization to this innovation in IT access and use. Extending theories of the firm that recognize the importance of downstream transfers (selling as opposed to sourcing) and plural governance in organizational design, we predict IT-driven shifts in downstream vertical integration. In a detailed panel of Census Bureau data for over 5,600 manufacturing plants, we observe the extent of a production unit’s downstream transactions within the firm alongside concurrent sales to external customers—a mix we refer to as plural selling. Our main finding is that the use of the internet for external coordination precipitated a significant decline in downstream vertical integration across the manufacturing sector. Instrumental variables estimation points to a causal relationship but also heterogeneous treatment effects. Key drivers of plural organization, such as complementarities and constraints across differently governed transactions, help explain such heterogeneity, as does concurrent use of internal production management IT. Our study is the first study to leverage a plural governance framework and large-scale microdata to understand how U.S. production chain organization shifted in response to this rapid and far-reaching technological change.

In the raw data, measured misallocation (following Hsieh and Klenow 2009) is substantially higher than for any other country for which we have census data. For instance, if Indian firms had the same dispersion of distortions as measured in the reported US data, TFP in the Indian manufacturing sector would decrease by around 2/3. Second, we follow a different strategy for editing and imputing missing data than what is used by the US Census Bureau, by using a method that seeks to replicate the true variance in the underlying data generating process known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART).

Watching the grass grow: does recreational cannabis legalization affect retail and agricultural wages?,2022,[],Sichao Jiang; Keaton Miller,Sichao Jiang; Keaton Miller,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-022-00149-6,"Over the past several years, cannabis has become legal for recreational use in many US states and jurisdictions around the world. The opening of these markets has led to the establishment of hundreds of cannabis production and retail firms with accompanying demand for labor, leading to concerns about spillover effects on wages from incumbents.We study the markets for agricultural and retail labor in Washington and Colorado from 2000 to 2019 using differences-in-differences with synthetic controls. We employ employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, state-level demographic data from the US Census Bureau, and agricultural data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. We use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection and classification and regression trees (CART) for chained imputation of missing values.We find little-to-no evidence of a significant difference in weekly wages per worker generated by cannabis legalization: the log of the weekly wage per worker decreases by 0.013 in Washington's agricultural sector (p value 0.091) and increases by 0.059 in Washington's retail sector (p value 0.606).

Importing Political Polarization?

Analyzing multiple measures of political expression and results of congressional and presidential elections spanning the period 2000 through 2016, we find strong though not definitive evidence of an ideological realignment in trade-exposed local labor markets that commences prior to the divisive 2016 US presidential election. Exploiting the exogenous component of rising import competition by China, we find that trade exposed electoral districts simultaneously exhibit growing ideological polarization in some domains, meaning expanding support for both strong-left and strong-right views, and pure rightward shifts in others. Specifically, trade-impacted commuting zones or districts saw an increasing market share for the Fox News channel (a rightward shift), stronger ideological polarization in campaign contributions (a polarized shift), and a relative rise in the likelihood of electing a Republican to Congress (a rightward shift). Trade-exposed counties with an initial majority White population became more likely to elect a GOP conservative, while trade-exposed counties with an initial majority-minority population became more likely to elect a liberal Democrat, where in both sets of counties, these gains came at the expense of moderate Democrats (a polarized shift). In presidential elections, counties with greater trade exposure shifted toward the Republican candidate (a rightward shift). These results broadly support an emerging political economy literature that connects adverse economic shocks to sharp ideological realignments that cleave along racial and ethnic lines and induce discrete shifts in political preferences and economic policy.

We survey the growing literature investigating the causes and consequences of China's urban pollution challenges. We begin by studying how urban population and industrial growth impacts local pollution levels and greenhouse gas production. As the urban population grows richer, its demand for private transportation and electricity sharply increases. Such privately beneficial activity exacerbates urban pollution externalities. Facing these severe environmental challenges, China's urbanites increasingly demand quality of life progress. We survey the emerging literature investigating the demand for environmental progress in China. Progress in mitigating externalities hinges on whether the powerful central and local governments choose to address these issues. We analyze the political economy of whether government officials have strong incentives to tackle lingering urban externalities. We conclude by discussing future research opportunities at the intersection of environmental and urban economics.

Banks more exposed to EAWA did not substitute their internal innovation with the acquisition of external patents.

Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm's workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees’ job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions.

The SPM has advantages over the official poverty measure, including a more defensible adjustment for family size and composition, an expanded definition of the family unit that includes cohabitors, and a definition of income that is conceptually closer to resources available for consumption. The SPM's definition of income, though conceptually broader than pre-tax money income, is difficult to implement given available data and their accuracy. Furthermore, income data do not capture consumption out of savings and tangible assets such as houses and cars. A consumption-based measure has similar advantages but fewer disadvantages. We compare those added to and dropped from the poverty rolls by the alternative measures relative to the current official measure. We find that the SPM adds to poverty individuals who are more likely to be college graduates, own a home and a car, live in a larger housing unit, have air conditioning, health insurance, and substantial assets, and have other more favorable characteristics than those who are dropped from poverty. Meanwhile, we find that a consumption measure compared to the official measure or the SPM adds to the poverty rolls individuals who are more disadvantaged than those who are dropped. We decompose the differences between the SPM and official poverty and find that the most problematic aspect of the SPM is the subtraction of medical out-of-pocket expenses from SPM income. Also, because the SPM poverty thresholds change in an odd way over time, it will be hard to determine if changes in poverty are due to changes in income or changes in thresholds.

We use a model of endogenous offshoring to characterize this simultaneity and to derive an instrumental variables strategy allowing us to estimate the impact of offshore hiring on domestic employment. Our IV strategy exploits variation in offshoring costs across countries, industries, and time that results from the implementation of bilateral tax treaties, and uses Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) firm-level data for U.S. multinationals across two decades. We confirm that new treaties are unrelated to existing employment trends, and proceed to estimate the effects of offshoring on U.S. employment within multinational firms, industry-wide, and within local labor markets. We find that a 10 percent increase in foreign affiliate employment increases domestic U.S. employment for existing multinational firms by 1.4 percent, consistent with increased scale of production following a decline in global production costs. However, industry-wide U.S. employment increases by only one-third as much, as the opening of new offshore production facilities generates substitution for workers that had been hired domestically. We estimate slightly larger effects for local labor markets, suggesting there are possible spillovers across industries in the same location. Throughout the analysis, OLS estimates, which fail to account for the simultaneity of domestic and offshore employment, are more than 3 times larger than the preferred IV estimates. Overall, our results indicate that greater offshore activity raises net employment by U.S. firms.",,,,"bea, bureau","Offshoring, Multinational corporation, Business, Labour economics, Economics, International trade, International economics, Outsourcing, Marketing, Finance"

I develop a model in which firms optimally undertake such replacement when their productivity is low. Hence, firms with routine‐task labor maintain a replacement option that hedges their value against unfavorable macroeconomic shocks and lowers their expected returns. Using establishment‐level occupational data, I construct a measure of firms' share of routine‐task labor. Compared to their industry peers, firms with a higher share of routine‐task labor (i) invest more in machines and reduce more routine‐task labor during economic downturns, and (ii) have lower expected stock returns.",Carnegie Mellon University; Miami University; University of Hong Kong,"Cesare Fracassi; Chris Jones; George Korniotis; Jay Shanken; Jerry Hoberg; John Griffin; Jonathan Berk; Jonathan Cohn; Jun Li (discussant); Lars-Alexander Kuehn (discussant); Matthias Kehrig; Miao Ben Zhang is at Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California.

Sectoral distortions manifest at the aggregate level via two channels: total factor productivity (TFP) and the labor wedge. We show that near efficiency, distortions have zero first-order effects on TFP and nonzero first-order effects on the labor wedge, and that a sufficient statistic for the latter are the Domar weights. We thereby provide a Hulten-like theorem for the aggregate effects of sectoral distortions.

Liberalization increases capital overall. For domestic firms with initially high marginal revenue products of capital (MRPK), liberalization increases revenues by 23%, physical capital by 53%, wage bills by 28%, and reduces MRPK by 33% relative to low MRPK firms. The effects of liberalization are largest in areas with less developed local banking sectors, indicating that inefficiencies in that sector may cause misallocation.

This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment and productivity. Thus, second moment shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to VAR estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital convex and non-convex adjustment costs. Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Stanford University - Department of Economics, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Stanford University - Department of Economics,"national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Economics, Econometrics, Environmental science"

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother's residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low-birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Los Angeles; Princeton University; University of Chicago","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA.","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA.","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Hydraulic fracturing, Environmental science, Medicine, Environmental health, Geology, Petroleum engineering"

The governance indicators measure the following six dimensions of governance: (1) voice and accountability; (2) political instability and violence; (3) government effectiveness; (4) regulatory quality; (5) rule of law, and (6) control of corruption. They cover 209 countries and territories for 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. They are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 37 separate data sources constructed by 31 organizations. The authors present estimates of the six dimensions of governance for each period, as well as margins of error capturing the range of likely values for each country. These margins of error are not unique to perceptions-based measures of governance, but are an important feature of all efforts to measure governance, including objective indicators. In fact, the authors give examples of how individual objective measures provide an incomplete picture of even the quite particular dimensions of governance that they are intended to measure. The authors also analyze in detail changes over time in their estimates of governance; provide a framework for assessing the statistical significance of changes in governance; and suggest a simple rule of thumb for identifying statistically significant changes in country governance over time. The ability to identify significant changes in governance over time is much higher for aggregate indicators than for any individual indicator. While the authors find that the quality of governance in a number of countries has changed significantly (in both directions), they also provide evidence suggesting that there are no trends, for better or worse, in global averages of governance. Finally, they interpret the strong observed correlation between income and governance, and argue against recent efforts to apply a discount to governance performance in low-income countries.

Do Female Executives Make a Difference? The Impact of Female Leadership on Gender Gaps and Firm Performance,2019,[],Luca Flabbi; Mario Macis; Andrea Moro; Fabiano Schivardi,Luca Flabbi; Mario Macis; Andrea Moro; Fabiano Schivardi,https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uez012,"Abstract We investigate the effects of female executives on gender-specific wage distributions and firm performance. Female leadership has a positive impact at the top of the female wage distribution and a negative impact at the bottom. The impact of female leadership on firm performance increases with the share of female workers. We account for the endogeneity induced by non-random executives’ gender by including firm fixed-effects, by generating controls from a two-way fixed-effects regression and by using instruments based on regional trends. The findings are consistent with a model of statistical discrimination in which female executives are better at interpreting signals of productivity from female workers. This suggests substantial costs of women under-representation among executives.",Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli; Johns Hopkins University; Ca' Foscari University of Venice; Vanderbilt University,"Vanderbilt University and Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia; University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, CPC-UNC, IZA, and CHILD-CCA; LUISS University, EIEF and CEPR; Johns Hopkins University, CRENoS, IZA and NBER","Vanderbilt University and Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia; University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, CPC-UNC, IZA, and CHILD-CCA; LUISS University, EIEF and CEPR; Johns Hopkins University, CRENoS, IZA and NBER","cepr, nber","Endogeneity, Demographic economics, Productivity, Wage, Distribution (mathematics), Statistical discrimination, Representation (politics), Gender gap, Economics, Labour economics, Econometrics, Political science, Economic growth, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Politics, Law"

Our data include unusually detailed job information for each worker, which enables us to define seven hierarchical ranks that are consistent across establishments and over time in order to measure promotions (defined as year-to-year rank increases) even for individuals who change employers. We first find that women have significantly lower promotion rates than men across all ranks of the corporate hierarchy, even after controlling for a range of individual characteristics (age, education, tenure, experience) and including fixed effects for current rank, year, industry, and even work establishment. In measuring the effects of female coworkers, we find positive gender spillovers across ranks (flowing from higher-ranking to lower-ranking women) but negative spillovers within ranks. The finding that greater female representation at higher ranks narrows the gender gap in promotion rates at lower ranks suggests that policies that increase female representation in corporate leadership can have spillover benefits to women in lowers ranks.",Norwegian School of Economics; University of Virginia,"NHH Norwegian School of Economics; University of Virginia, IZA, and NBER","NHH Norwegian School of Economics; University of Virginia, IZA, and NBER","irs, nber","Private sector, Business, Labour economics, Economics, Demographic economics, Public relations, Economic growth, Political science"

The passage of this law resulted in a significant decline in shareholder value for firms headquartered in California. The decline in shareholder value is directly related to the number of female directors that firms are required to add under these quotas. We argue that supply-side constraints contribute to the costs imposed by the mandate. The expected costs of the quotas are higher for firms that face a more limited director pool and for those with weak corporate governance. Earnings forecasts for California firms also decline after the passage of the law. The law is associated with a widening of credit default spreads for affected firms, suggesting that differences in risk-taking preferences between male and female directors do not explain the results.",Korea University; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Centre for Economic Policy Research; Flagler College,University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill - Kenan-Flagler Business School; Korea University Business School; University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill - Kenan-Flagler Business School; Korea University Business School; University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),"cepr, irs","Business, Political science"
Who Wears the Pants?

This pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which constrain women's influence over intrahousehold financial decision‐making. A randomized controlled experiment reveals that female identity hinders idea contribution by the wife. These findings underscore the roles of intrahousehold bargaining and traditional norms in shaping household financial decisions.",American Economic Association; University of Hong Kong,"I am deeply indebted to my advisor, Henrik Cronqvist, for his invaluable guidance and constant support.

Cross-sectional uncertainty varied little between 1980 and 1995, and subsequently had three distinct peaks -- during the tech boom, the financial crisis, and the coronavirus epidemic. Cross-sectional uncertainty has had a mixed relationship with overall economic activity, and aggregate uncertainty is much more powerful for forecasting aggregate growth. The data and moments can be used to calibrate and test structural models of the effects of uncertainty shocks. In international data, we find similar dynamics and a strong common factor in cross-sectional uncertainty. The data is available on our websites.

It also explains the cyclical behaviour of empirical measures of uncertainty. In the presence of matching frictions, an occasionally binding constraint on downward wage adjustment enhances the concavity of firms’ hiring rule, resulting in an endogenous profit risk-premium. In turn, higher uncertainty increases the profit risk-premium when the economy operates close to the wage constraint, deepening a recession. Non-linear local projections and vector autoregression estimates support the model predictions.

The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1% to 8%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor market dynamism.",Pompeu Fabra University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University Press; Centre for Economic Policy Research; KU Leuven; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, Graduate School of Economics); Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Harvard University","Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, Graduate School of Economics); Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Harvard University","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Economics, Market power, Dynamism, Markup language, Monetary economics, Wage share, Market share, Profitability index, Distribution (mathematics), Profit (economics), Marginal cost, Labour economics, Microeconomics, Monopoly, Wage, Mathematical analysis, Physics, Mathematics, Finance, Quantum mechanics, Computer science, XML, Efficiency wage, Operating system"

Design We estimate a difference‐in‐difference‐in‐differences model to separately identify the effects of the nationwide and Medicaid expansion portions of the ACA using the methodology developed in the recent ACA literature. The differences come from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre‐ ACA uninsured rates. In order to focus on access disparities, we stratify our sample separately by income, race/ethnicity, marital status, age, gender, and geography. Principal Findings After three years, the fully implemented ACA eliminated 43% of the coverage gap across income groups, with the Medicaid expansion accounting for this entire reduction. The ACA also reduced coverage disparities across racial groups by 23%, across marital status by 46%, and across age‐groups by 36%, with these changes being partly attributable to both the Medicaid expansion and nationwide components of the law.

Sommers,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22158,"Abstract As we approach the tenth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is important to reflect on what has been learned about the impacts of this major reform. In this paper, we review the literature on the impacts of the ACA on patients, providers, and the economy. We find strong evidence that the ACA's provisions have increased insurance coverage. There is also a clearly positive effect on access to and consumption of health care, with suggestive but more limited evidence on improved health outcomes. There is no evidence of significant reductions in provider access, changes in labor supply, or increased budgetary pressures on state governments, and the law's total federal cost through 2018 has been less than predicted. We conclude by describing key policy implications and future areas for research.",National Bureau of Economic Research; IIT@MIT,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Public Health Department of Health Policy and Management 677 Huntington Avenue Kresge 406 Boston, MA 02115; Department of Economics, E52-434 MIT 50 Memorial Drive Cambridge, MA 02142 and","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Public Health Department of Health Policy and Management 677 Huntington Avenue Kresge 406 Boston, MA 02115; Department of Economics, E52-434 MIT 50 Memorial Drive Cambridge, MA 02142 and","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Health insurance, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Consumption (sociology), State (computer science), Public economics, Business, Health care, Economics, Actuarial science, Economic growth, Social science, Algorithm, Sociology, Computer science"

These indicators are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 25 separate data sources constructed by 18 different organizations. The authors assign these individual measures of governance to categories capturing key dimensions of governance and use an unobserved components model to construct six aggregate governance indicators in each of the four periods. They present the point estimates of the dimensions of governance as well as the margins of errors for each country for the four periods. The governance indicators reported here are an update and expansion of previous research work on indicators initiated in 1998 (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobatón 1999a, b and 2002). The authors also address various methodological issues, including the interpretation and use of the data given the estimated margins of errors. This paper—a joint product of the Global Governance Department, World Bank Institute, and Macroeconomics and Growth, Development Research Group—is part of a larger effort in the Bank to generate and analyze worldwide governance indicators, and to assess the causes and consequences of governance.

The Protective Role of Medicaid Expansion for Low‐Income People During the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 Pandemic,2025,[],Aparna Soni; Kevin N. Griffith,Aparna Soni; Kevin N. Griffith,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14444,"During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 47.5 million Americans lost their employer-sponsored health insurance. While many were able to transition to plans from other family members, 56% became uninsured [1]—a deleterious result during the height of a pandemic. Lower-income workers are most likely to be laid off and lose coverage during economic downturns, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access [2, 3]. Medicaid served as an essential lifeline for individuals and families during the pandemic, and enrollment rose steadily throughout 2020, especially in states that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) [4]. While health and income losses during the pandemic were widespread, a growing body of literature demonstrates that residents of Medicaid expansion states suffered less than their non-expansion peers. Thus, Medicaid may provide important protective benefits and increase the resiliency of our health system. This commentary synthesizes the growing literature that examines the impacts of Medicaid expansion on low-income individuals during the pandemic. Many studies have found that state investments in public health, particularly through Medicaid expansion, helped protect low-income individuals from some of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We begin by describing the landscape of Medicaid policy at the onset of the pandemic. We then provide a synopsis of the emerging body of literature that studies the effects of Medicaid expansion during the pandemic. We conclude by discussing challenges and opportunities for Medicaid expansion as a vehicle to protect low-income people during future public health emergencies. President Donald J. Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a nationwide emergency on March 13th, 2020 [5]. By this date, 35 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid under the ACA [6]. A voluminous literature generally demonstrates that, compared to non-expanders, residents of Medicaid expansion states experienced better access to care [7-9] and improved health outcomes [10-13] during the pre-pandemic period and that these benefits disproportionately accrued to low-income or minoritized populations [14-16]. When the pandemic struck, the Medicaid program stood ready to fill an essential role protecting low-income individuals and essential workers, who were most susceptible to the pandemic's adverse effects. Expansion states were better positioned to take advantage of federal policy changes that were implemented to strengthen Medicaid, such as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 (FFCRA). As part of the FFCRA, all state Medicaid programs adopted maintenance of eligibility and continuous coverage provisions that essentially prohibited states from terminating most enrollees' coverage until after the end of the public health emergency. However, these provisions were expected to increase mandatory spending during an especially challenging time for state budgets due to declining income and sales tax revenues. The FFCRA provided states with an additional 6.2 percentage point increase in federal matching assistance percentage (FMAP) to offset these costs (from a baseline FMAP range of 56.20% to 83.18% across states). The continuous coverage provision was associated with unprecedented increases in Medicaid enrollment, reducing churn and access disruptions among enrollees. Between February 2020 and January 2023, enrollment increased more than 30% or 21 million people nationwide [17]. As we describe below, residents of Medicaid expansion states benefitted most from the FFCRA during the pandemic. A surge of new research is shedding light on the crucial role Medicaid expansions under the ACA had during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for low-income Americans. Studies using quasi-experimental research designs show that compared to non-expansion states, Medicaid expansions improved access to care and boosted health outcomes for low-income populations. The key results of 11 such studies are summarized in Table 1. We restricted our focus to studies that examined the effects of state Medicaid expansions during the pandemic and employed rigorous quasi-experimental designs. Most of these studies applied either regression discontinuity or difference-in-differences approaches to compare outcomes in states that did and did not expand Medicaid, before and after the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency. We excluded descriptive or cross-sectional studies from our summary. The first set of studies looked at the association between Medicaid expansions and rates of insurance coverage during the pandemic. There are several reasons to expect insurance rates in expansion and non-expansion states to diverge after March 2020, when the pandemic and its associated recession caused widespread job loss. In Medicaid expansion states, workers who lost jobs and income during the pandemic became eligible for Medicaid at higher income thresholds. Moreover, expansion states were better positioned to leverage federal policy changes such as the FFCRA because a larger proportion of their low-income adult populations were already eligible for or covered by Medicaid. Indeed, empirical studies found that Medicaid expansion protected low-income populations from a rise in uninsurance during the pandemic. One of the earliest studies published in this space, Khorrami and Sommers (2021), used state-level data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to compare changes in Medicaid enrollment between 2019 and 2020 in expansion versus non-expansion states. The authors found that expansion status was associated with higher Medicaid enrollment growth in the early months of the pandemic [4]. Subsequent studies used survey data to examine changes in insurance coverage. For example, Auty et al. (2023) studied data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and found uninsurance decreased for all racial and income groups in expansion states. Furthermore, these decreases were concentrated among Black, multiracial, and low-income adults [18]. Figueroa et al. (2021) surveyed low-income, working-age adults in four southern states and found that the expansions were associated with reductions in uninsurance among Black and Latinx individuals [19]. Elani et al. (2023) found that the combination of Medicaid expansion with coverage of adult dental benefits improved access to dental care [20]. We are aware of two studies that specifically examined churning between different sources of coverage. Benitez (2022) used CPS data to study a sample of working-age adults who were employed before the pandemic and found that the expansions were associated with an increase in unemployment-related Medicaid enrollment and greater probability of being able to transition from employer insurance to Medicaid [21]. Jacobs & Moriya (2023) used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) panel data on non-elderly people and found that the expansions were associated with increased shifts from uninsurance to Medicaid after the onset of the pandemic [22]. For the most part, the empirical literature has found little effect of the Medicaid expansions on financial barriers to care during the pandemic [18, 19]. Figueroa et al. (2021) argued the growing burden of nonfinancial barriers may be to blame [19]; many Americans avoided care voluntarily due to fear of COVID-19 infection or involuntary cancelation of elective procedures by hospitals and providers [23]. Auty et al. (2023) echoed this concern and argued that measurement issues with the BRFSS may be to blame; given widespread fear of infection and cancellation of elective procedures, survey respondents may no longer identify cost as the most salient reason for foregone care [18]. While this commentary focuses on quasi-experimental studies, we note that several other studies used post-pandemic data only to compare access to care in expansion and non-expansion states and found promising evidence that Medicaid expansion benefited low-income populations during the pandemic. This research found that the steep declines in insurance coverage at the beginning of the pandemic were concentrated in non-expansion states [24] and that expansion states experienced increasing rates of both employment and public insurance coverage as the pandemic unfolded [25]. Moreover, relative to their counterparts in non-expansion states, people in Medicaid expansion states who experienced COVID-linked job loss were less likely to be uninsured, more likely to have Medicaid, less likely to have unpaid medical bills, and less likely to have calls from debt collection agencies [21, 26, 27]. These findings complement the quasi-experimental literature summarized above and point to the potential of Medicaid expansion to insulate low-income households from the diminished healthcare access and financial distress that comes in times of public health crises. Much has been written about the sharp contraction in health services utilization following the pandemic's onset, although there is a dearth of literature comparing expansion and non-expansion states. Marinacci et al. (2023) looked at cardiovascular-related screenings and management and found expansion increased diabetes screening rates. However, there were no effects on other health-promoting behaviors such as cholesterol testing, hypertension treatment, insulin utilization, or receipt of diabetes-related care [28]. Avtar et al. (2022) compared counties by expansion status using a regression discontinuity design. Counties in expansion states experienced higher rates of COVID-19 testing, similar rates of physician office visits and hospital bed utilization, and lower rates of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization [29]. A lack of appointment availability during the public health emergency may have blunted the potential positive effects of Medicaid effects on health services utilization [23]. Overall, Americans reported increased sleep hours, higher rates of exercise participation, greater alcohol consumption, and lower rates of smoking during the pandemic [30]. Health insurance coverage, including Medicaid, may reduce enrollees' allostatic load and facilitate greater investments in self-care and health-promoting behaviors. Unfortunately, we located only one study that compared changes in health-related behaviors between states that did and did not expand Medicaid. Rakus and Soni (2022) analyzed BRFSS data and found that expansions were associated with lower rates of smoking and heavy drinking and higher flu vaccination rates during the pandemic [31]. However, this study found no correlation between state expansion status and exercise participation rates or obesity. Further research is needed to determine whether differences in health-related behaviors contributed to the variation in outcomes between states that expanded Medicaid and those that did not. More than 1.2 million Americans died due to COVID-19 as of September 2024 [32]. Compared to non-expanders, expansion states had higher insurance rates, and their residents were more likely to report a usual source of care before the pandemic struck. There is reason to believe they were more likely to receive and follow health-promoting information from primary care physicians via telehealth, reduce unnecessary exposure in waiting rooms, and thus have better health outcomes during the pandemic. Moreover, by improving adults' baseline health before the pandemic, Medicaid expansion may have reduced the likelihood of unmanaged health conditions, making serious illness and death from COVID-19 less likely in expansion states. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, Americans reported better physical health and similar mental health during 2020 [30]. The empirical literature on Medicaid expansion and pandemic-related health outcomes is mixed. Rakus and Soni (2022) found that expansions were associated with improvements in self-assessed physical health but had no effect on mental health for low-income adults [31]. A subsequent study by Oyeka and Wehby (2023) found that for certain subgroups of low-income people, such as adults younger than 45, women, and some racial minorities, Medicaid expansion was associated with better mental health during the pandemic [33]. Auty and Griffith (2022) found that while drug and opioid overdose death rates increased rapidly during the pandemic, these changes were not related to state Medicaid expansion [34]. Avtar et al. (2022) presented data on county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths and compared COVID-19 outcomes in bordering counties across expansion and non-expansion states. They found no effect of Medicaid expansion for either the overall population or various age, race, and ethnic subgroups [29]. The literature reviewed in this commentary underscores Medicaid expansion's critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic but has limitations. Unlike pre-pandemic studies, these analyses cannot leverage states' staggered Medicaid adoption decisions to control for potential confounding factors. Instead, this work relies on pre- and post-pandemic comparisons in expansion versus non-expansion states, making it harder to isolate the effects of Medicaid expansion from other correlated policies. Although most studies control for pandemic-related policies like mask mandates and stay-at-home orders, expansion states may have also implemented additional pre-pandemic safety net benefits. These could include more generous unemployment insurance, higher minimum wages, expanded housing assistance programs, or robust food assistance initiatives like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enhancements. These correlated benefits complicate efforts to isolate the specific effects of Medicaid expansion during the pandemic. Additionally, the continuous coverage provision confounds analyses by making it challenging to disentangle the specific effects of Medicaid expansion from the broader impacts of this universal policy. Both may have contributed to increased access to care and financial stability for low-income populations during the pandemic, but their intertwined effects obscure a clear understanding of Medicaid expansion's unique role. Additionally, most studies used data from 2020 to 2021 due to lags in availability, despite the public health emergency extending into 2023. Surveys collected early in the pandemic faced challenges like low response rates and potential non-response bias, although post-stratification weighting may ameliorate some of these issues. More research is needed to evaluate Medicaid expansion's role across the full pandemic, particularly for outcomes like COVID-19 morbidity, mortality, and prevention. A growing literature, summarized above, suggests that Medicaid expansion was associated with increased insurance coverage, improved access to care, improved some health-related behaviors, and eased financial strain among low-income people during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed during the pandemic that reliance on employer-sponsored insurance makes us less resilient during times of economic downturn. Nearly 14.6 million workers and their dependents lost employer-sponsored insurance coverage during the first four months of the COVID-19 public health emergency [35]. By ensuring the health and protection of low-income populations, Medicaid expansion can help offset losses during public health emergencies and economic downturns. However, a lack of public awareness may have diminished Medicaid's effectiveness. Survey evidence suggests that millions of enrollees were unaware their coverage was maintained during the pandemic and mistakenly self-identified as uninsured [36]. States may not have effectively communicated that individuals were automatically retained on Medicaid during the pandemic, and many beneficiaries misunderstood the continuous coverage provision or its impact on their eligibility. This ""Medicaid undercount"" weakens the program's ability to improve access, increase health services utilization, and enhance health outcomes [37]. Despite these benefits, the Medicaid program faces several challenges ahead. First, there has been a surge in disenrollment starting in 2023. Over 25 million people lost their Medicaid coverage since the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, as states resume the pre-pandemic process of periodically redetermining eligibility for Medicaid [38]. A survey found that roughly half of those who lost Medicaid coverage became uninsured, and even those who moved to new insurance experienced coverage gaps and reported challenges accessing care [39]. Additionally, not all states expanded Medicaid to cover their low-income populations. Five states expanded during the pandemic including Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, South Dakota, and North Carolina. The remaining 10 holdout states lack feasible options for expansion via executive order or ballot initiative; endorsement from their state legislatures is paramount. The next administration should support creative Section 1115 waivers that encourage the remaining non-expansion states to adopt Medicaid in ways that work for them. For instance, Arkansas received approval for a market-based approach, allowing Medicaid enrollees to buy private health plans through the state's individual insurance exchange. Providing states with similar flexibility and incentives could expand Medicaid in the remaining 10 states, benefiting low-income populations and strengthening our resilience in future public health emergencies and recessions. Significant gaps in our understanding of Medicaid expansion's protective effects remain, and future research must address these to provide a clearer picture. Researchers need to disentangle the effects of Medicaid expansion from other public program benefits and the continuous coverage provision by leveraging detailed policy variation across states and over time. Comparative studies that incorporate granular data on state-level policy generosity and timing, as well as natural experiments or simulation models, could help isolate the distinct contributions of Medicaid expansion. Current studies relying on 2020 and 2021 data offer valuable insights into the immediate impacts during the pandemic, but longer term analyses are crucial as more recent data become available. These studies will be essential to fully understanding how Medicaid expansion's effects evolved, particularly as pandemic era policies like the continuous coverage provision phase out and states adapt their public programs. The human cost of COVID-19 has been enormous, and the pandemic's economic fallout sharply reduced access to care as layoffs ended employer-sponsored health insurance. These pains were disproportionately experienced by low-income individuals and their families. A growing empirical literature suggests that enhanced access to Medicaid offset some of the negative financial and health impacts. Holdout states should view Medicaid expansion as a way to strengthen health system resilience, safeguard low-income populations, and reduce the risk of worsening socioeconomic disparities in future pandemics.

Investing in Infants: the Lasting Effects of Cash Transfers to New Families,2022,[],Andrew Barr; Jonathan Eggleston; Alexander A.

We take advantage of the January 1 birthdate cutoff for U.S. child-related tax benefits, which results in families of otherwise similar children receiving substantially different refunds during the first year of life. For the average low-income single-child family in our sample, this difference amounts to roughly ${\$}$1,300, or 10% of income. Using the universe of administrative federal tax data in selected years, we show that this transfer in infancy increases young adult earnings by at least 1%–2%, with larger effects for males. These effects show up at earlier ages in terms of improved math and reading test scores and a higher likelihood of high-school graduation. The observed effects on shorter-run parental outcomes suggest that additional liquidity during the critical window following the birth of a first child leads to persistent increases in family income that likely contribute to the downstream effects on children’s outcomes. The longer-term effects on child earnings alone are large enough that the transfer pays for itself through subsequent increases in federal income tax revenue.",United States Military Academy; Mitchell Institute; Texas A&M University; United States Census Bureau,"Texas A&M University , United States; U.S. Military Academy , West Point, United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States","Texas A&M University , United States; U.S. Military Academy , West Point, United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States","irs, census bureau, bureau","Earnings, Graduation (instrument), Economics, Demographic economics, Market liquidity, Cash transfers, Sample (material), Income tax, Revenue, Transfer (computing), Cash, Monetary economics, Demography, Finance, Public economics, Chemistry, Geometry, Mathematics, Chromatography, Parallel computing, Computer science, Sociology"

They rely on a newly assembled dataset that draws from different micro data sources (business registers, census, or representative enterprise surveys). The novelty of their approach is in the harmonization of firm-level data across countries, which enables international comparisons and the identification of country-specific factors as opposed to sector and time effects. All countries display a massive reallocation of resources, with the entry and exit of many firms in all markets, the failure of many newcomers, and the expansion of successful ones. This process of creative destruction affects productivity directly by reallocating resources toward more productive uses, but also indirectly through the effects of increased market contestability. There are also large differences across groups of countries. While entry and exit rates are fairly similar across industrial countries, post-entry performance differs markedly between Europe and the United States, a potential indication of the importance of barriers to firm growth as opposed to barriers to entry. Transition economies show an even more impressive process of creative destruction and those that have progressed the most toward a market economy show better outcomes from this process. Finally, Mexico shows large firm dynamics with many new firms entering the battle but also many failing rapidly, while Argentina resembles Continental Europe with smaller flows and less impressive post-entry growth of successful firms. This paper—a product of the Social Protection Team, Human Development Network—is part of a larger effort in the network to understand the process of creative destruction.

Both are simultaneously determined by countries' capabilities, that is, by countries' productivity and quality levels for each good. Our theoretical setup has two features. (1) Some goods have fewer high-quality producers/countries than others, meaning that there is comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and low-quality producers to coexist. These two features generate an inverted-U, general equilibrium relationship between a country's export mix and its GDP per capita.

Firm Heterogeneity in Consumption Baskets: Evidence from Home and Store Scanner Data,2021,[],Benjamin Faber; Thibault Fally,Benjamin Faber; Thibault Fally,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab061,"Abstract A growing literature has documented the role of firm heterogeneity within sectors for nominal income inequality. This article explores the implications for household price indices across the income distribution. Using detailed matched U.S. home and store scanner microdata, we present evidence that rich and poor households source their consumption differently across the firm size distribution within disaggregated product groups. We use the data to examine alternative explanations, propose a tractable quantitative model with two-sided heterogeneity that rationalizes the observed moments, and calibrate it to explore general equilibrium counterfactuals. We find that larger, more productive firms sort into catering to the taste of richer households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric effects on household price indices. We quantify these effects in the context of policy counterfactuals that affect the distribution of disposable incomes on the demand side or profits across firms on the supply side.","University of California, Berkeley","Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER; Department of Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER","Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER; Department of Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER","nber, microdata","Microdata (statistics), Economics, Consumption (sociology), Counterfactual conditional, Econometrics, Distribution (mathematics), Context (archaeology), Inequality, Microeconomics, Counterfactual thinking, Social science, Population, Philosophy, Mathematical analysis, Demography, Mathematics, Paleontology, Epistemology, Sociology, Census, Biology"

Until 2002, diplomatic immunity protected UN diplomats from parking enforcement actions, so diplomats’ actions were constrained by cultural norms alone. We find a strong effect of corruption norms: diplomats from high‐corruption countries (on the basis of existing survey‐based indices) accumulated significantly more unpaid parking violations. In 2002, enforcement authorities acquired the right to confiscate diplomatic license plates of violators. Unpaid violations dropped sharply in response. Cultural norms and (particularly in this context) legal enforcement are both important determinants of corruption.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Enforcement, License, Context (archaeology), Language change, Business, Law enforcement, Political science, Law, Geography, Art, Literature, Archaeology"

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",Columbia University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University Press; Arizona State University; Boston University; Max Planck Institute for Human Development; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Harvard University,"Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;; Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; Technology &amp; Policy Research Initiative, School of Law, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215;; Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;; Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; Department of Public Policy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599;; Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Grupo Interdisciplinar de Sistemas Complejos, Departmento de Matematicas, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, 28911 Madrid, Spain;; School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287;; Columbia University, New York, NY,; Graduate School of Education, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, 14195 Berlin, Germany; Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;","Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;; Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; Technology &amp; Policy Research Initiative, School of Law, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215;; Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;; Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; Department of Public Policy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599;; Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Grupo Interdisciplinar de Sistemas Complejos, Departmento de Matematicas, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, 28911 Madrid, Spain;; School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287;; Columbia University, New York, NY,; Graduate School of Education, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;; Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, 14195 Berlin, Germany; Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Technological change, Automation, Productivity, Unemployment, Emerging technologies, Complementarity (molecular biology), Work (physics), Multidisciplinary approach, Computer science, Economics, Risk analysis (engineering), Business, Artificial intelligence, Engineering, Sociology, Economic growth, Mechanical engineering, Biology, Genetics, Social science"

Veugelers,https://doi.org/10.1093/icc/dtp052,"Recent policy initiatives in the EU aim at supporting so-called young highly innovative companies (YICs). This article provides empirical evidence from German CIS data on the innovative performances of this specific type of firms, supporting why they matter. We first characterize YICs in the sample of innovation active firms. We show that firms that combine newness, smallness, and high R&D intensity are rare in the sample of innovative firms, but achieve significantly higher innovative sales than other innovative firms, especially innovative sales that are new to the market. Not surprisingly, YICs view financial constraints, both internal and external, as an important factor hampering their innovation activities, significantly more so than other innovation active firms. This access to finance problem is an often used motive for government intervention. On the effectiveness of subsidies, our results suggest that the subsidy allocation mechanisms at place in Germany during the sample period are not associated with relatively higher innovative performance of the subsidized YICs as compared to other recipients.",Copenhagen Business School; Bruegel,"**Reinhilde Veugelers, K.U.

These data offer some advantages over both other publicly accessible trade data and confidential datasets, but they also have drawbacks.

Capturing these effects empirically has been challenging, as non-marginal insurance expansions are rare and detailed data on healthcare labor and capital is sparse. We combine administrative labor market data with the geographic variation in the rollout of a universal insurance program—the introduction of long-term care (LTC) insurance in Germany in 1995—to document a substantial expansion of the inpatient LTC labor market in response to insurance expansion. A 10 percentage point expansion in the share of insured elderly leads to 0.05 (7%) more inpatient LTC firms and four (13%) more workers per 1,000 elderly in Germany. Wages did not rise, but the quality of newly hired workers declined. We find suggestive evidence of a reduction in old-age mortality. Using a machine learning algorithm, we characterize counterfactual labor market biographies of potential inpatient LTC hires, finding that the reform moved workers into LTC jobs from unemployment and out of the labor force rather than from other sectors of the economy. We estimate that employing these additional workers in LTC is socially efficient if patients value the care provided by these workers at least at 25% of the market price for care. We show conceptually that, in the spirit of Harberger (1971), in a second-best equilibrium in which supply-side labor markets do not clear at perfectly competitive wages, subsidies for healthcare consumption along with the associated demand-side moral hazard can be welfare-enhancing.","Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Health Research; Institut für Arbeitsmarkt und Berufsforschung","Government of the Federal Republic of Germany - Institute for Employment Research (IAB); Stanford University - Department of Health Research and Policy; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)","Government of the Federal Republic of Germany - Institute for Employment Research (IAB); Stanford University - Department of Health Research and Policy; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)","national bureau of economic research, nber, bureau","Term (time), Economics, Long-term care insurance, General equilibrium theory, Actuarial science, Econometrics, Business, Long-term care, Medicine, Microeconomics, Nursing, Physics, Quantum mechanics"

We study a reform in Germany that abruptly abolished this mandate for stock corporations incorporated after August 1994, while it locked the mandate for the slightly older cohorts. Our research design compares firm cohorts incorporated before the reform and after; in a robustness check we draw on the analogous difference in unaffected firm types (LLCs). We find no effects of board-level codetermination on wages and the wage structure, even in firms with particularly flexible wages. The degree of rent sharing and the labor share are also unaffected. We reject that disinvestment could have offset wage effects through the canonical hold-up channel, as shared governance, if anything, increases capital formation.","Institut für Arbeitsmarkt und Berufsforschung; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology","University of California, Berkeley, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Germany","University of California, Berkeley, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Germany","national bureau of economic research, bureau","Mandate, Wage, Corporate governance, Labour economics, Shareholder, Economics, Robustness (evolution), Business, Finance, Political science, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Law, Gene"

The authors also present new country-level, general-equilibrium event studies of codetermination reforms between the 1960s and 2010s, finding no effects on aggregate economic outcomes or the quality of industrial relations. They offer three explanations for the institution’s limited impact. First, existing codetermination laws convey little authority to workers. Second, countries with codetermination laws have high baseline levels of informal worker voice. Third, codetermination laws may interact with other labor market institutions, such as union representation and collective bargaining.

Not surprisingly, we find that job-to-job moves reallocate younger workers disproportionately from less productive to more productive firms. More surprisingly, especially in the context of the recent literature on assortative matching with on-the-job search, we find that job-to-job moves disproportionately reallocate less educated workers up the job ladder. This finding holds even though we find that more educated workers are more likely to work with more productive firms. We find that while highly educated workers are less likely to match to low-productivity firms, they are also less likely to separate from them, with less educated workers more likely to separate to a better employer in expansions and to be shaken off the ladder (separate to nonemployment) in contractions.

However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms.

We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in administrative data using the universe of social security records in Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10–15% relative to similar jobs that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics services alone accounts for around 9% of the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s.",Boston University; Analysis Group (United States),"Analysis Group Boston University NBER, IZA, CESIfo, CEPR","Analysis Group Boston University NBER, IZA, CESIfo, CEPR","cepr, nber","Outsourcing, Wage, Business, Labour economics, Economic rent, German, Economics, Market economy, Marketing, Archaeology, History"

The Effects of Foreign Multinationals on Workers and Firms in the United States,2021,[],Bradley Setzler; Felix Tintelnot,Bradley Setzler; Felix Tintelnot,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab015,"Abstract Governments go to great lengths to attract foreign multinationals because they are thought to raise the wages paid to their employees (direct effects) and to improve outcomes at local domestic firms (indirect effects). We construct the first U.S. employer-employee data set with foreign ownership information from tax records to measure these direct and indirect effects. We find the average direct effect of a foreign multinational firm on its U.S. workers is a 7% increase in wages. This premium is larger for higher-skilled workers and for the employees of firms from high GDP per capita countries. We find evidence that it is membership in a multinational production network—instead of foreignness—that generates the foreign-firm premium. We leverage the past spatial clustering of foreign-owned firms by country of ownership to identify the indirect effects. An expansion in the foreign-multinational share of commuting-zone employment substantially increases the employment, value added, and—for higher-earning workers—wages at local domestic-owned firms. Per job created by a foreign multinational, our estimates suggest annual gains of US$13,400 to the aggregate wages of local incumbents, two-thirds of which are from indirect effects. Our estimates suggest that—via mega-deals for subsidies from local governments—foreign multinationals are able to extract a sizable fraction of the local surplus they generate.",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; University of Chicago, United States","University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; University of Chicago, United States","irs, national bureau of economic research, bureau","Multinational corporation, Foreign direct investment, Leverage (statistics), Business, Foreign ownership, Labour economics, Subsidy, Economics, Market economy, Finance, Machine learning, Computer science, Macroeconomics"
Institutions and the fortunes of territories,2020,[],Andrés Rodríguez‐Pose,Andrés Rodríguez‐Pose,https://doi.org/10.1111/rsp3.12277,"Regions and cities face unceasing pressures to adapt in response to processes of globalization, changes in industrial production, and new patterns of migration and trade. At the same time, the dominant development policies are proving less than capable of providing answers to these challenges. Strategies based on a mix of physical and human capital and technology have not succeeded in dealing with growing territorial inequality and its treacherous economic, social and political consequences. There is thus an urgent need to understand why territorial divergence occurs and why there is what seems to be a growing decline in the returns of public intervention targeting economic development. In the search for answers, scholars have turned to the examination of institutions. But despite progress in our grasp of how institutions affect development, crucial knowledge gaps remain. This paper reviews recent progress in our understanding of the role of institutions for development, unveils the most important gaps, and proposes a series of avenues to improve how a better understanding of how institutions shape regional and urban development can lead to more efficient development policies. Las regiones y las ciudades se enfrentan a presiones continuas de adaptación en respuesta a los procesos de globalización, cambios en la producción industrial y las nuevas pautas de migración y comercio. Al mismo tiempo, las políticas de desarrollo dominantes están demostrando ser menos capaces de dar respuestas a estos desafíos. Las estrategias basadas en una mezcla de capital físico y humano y tecnología no han logrado hacer frente a la creciente desigualdad territorial y sus peligrosas consecuencias económicas, sociales y políticas. Por consiguiente, es urgente comprender por qué se producen divergencias territoriales y por qué se produce lo que parece ser una disminución creciente de los beneficios de la intervención pública orientada al desarrollo económico. En la búsqueda de respuestas, la investigación ha recurrido al examen de las instituciones. Pero a pesar de los avances en la comprensión de cómo las instituciones afectan al desarrollo, siguen existiendo lagunas de conocimiento cruciales. En este artículo se examinan los progresos recientes en nuestra comprensión de la función de las instituciones para el desarrollo, se revelan las lagunas más importantes y se propone una serie de vías para mejorar la forma en que una mejor comprensión de la manera en que las instituciones configuran el desarrollo regional y urbano puede conducir a políticas de desarrollo más eficientes. 地域や都市は、グローバル化の過程、工業生産の変化、移住や商取引の新しいパターンに対応して適応させられる圧力に絶え間なく直面している。それと同時に、支配的開発政策は、これらの課題に対処する能力がないことが明らかになってきている。物理的資本と人的資本と技術の組み合わせを基にした戦略では、拡大する地域格差と、その危険性を孕む経済的、社会的、政治的影響には対処することができない。そのため、なぜ地域格差が生じているのか、なぜ経済発展を目的とした公的介入のリターンが減少しているようにみられるのかを解明することが急務である。答えを探すために、研究者たちは機関を調査することを始めた。しかし、制度が開発にどのように影響するか理解が進んでいるにもかかわらず、知識の大きなギャップが今なお存在している。本稿では、開発のための機関の役割に関する我々の理解の最近の進展を概観し、最も大きなギャップを明らかする。そして、機関が地域/都市開発をどのように形成しているかをよりよく理解することが、より効率的な開発政策につながる方法を改善するための一連の方法を提案する。 Regions and cities have been receiving ever-greater attention as the locus of socio-economic research and, increasingly, as the focus of development practice. Facing unceasing pressures to adapt and change in response to new and uncertain circumstances—including the onset of strong globalization forces, the spatial re-shifting of industrial production, and new patterns of international migration and trade—territories the world over, as well as the countries and supranational organizations they belong to, have sought to set up development strategies to restructure their economic bases in order to remain both competitive and sustainable. Most development strategies have been firmly anchored in traditional economic growth theory. According to the dominant theories in economics, economic growth and changes in employment and productivity are the result of a combination of three factors: physical capital, human capital or labour, and innovation. In addition, there is a residual factor or error term, which represents the part behind economic performance that we do not know or cannot explain using the traditional components of physical capital, human capital and innovation. Depending on the chosen approach to economic performance, the weight attributed to each of the components varies. The neoclassical growth strand (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) put the emphasis on physical capital. The endogenous growth approach (Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988) focused on human capital and innovation. In turn, the new economic geography (Fujita, Krugman, & Venables, 1999; Krugman, 1991, 2011) and urban economics (Glaeser, 2011) stressed the role of agglomeration economies, externalities and density. These three factors—plus agglomeration and density—continue to be the fundamental elements informing theoretical and empirical thinking about economic development policies and, consequently, development strategies across the world often remain anchored in these theoretical frameworks. The European Union's (EU) Cohesion policy—the largest development policy in the world—has been no exception. The bulk of cohesion investments have been channelled towards improving infrastructure endowment and accessibility, as well as increasing the availability and quality of human resources, and developing the innovative capacity of individuals and firms across the less developed areas of Europe. The impact of this type of intervention has been, however, controversial. For some (e.g., Becker, Egger, & von Ehrlich, 2010, 2018; Cappelen, Castellacci, Fagerberg, & Verspagen, 2003; Cerqua & Pellegrini, 2018; Crescenzi & Giua, 2020; Ferrara, McCann, Pellegrini, Stelder, & Terribile, 2017; ; Pellegrini, Terribile, Tarola, Muccigrosso, & Busillo, 2013), European-wide investment focusing on these three areas of intervention has delivered greater prosperity to those regions that have benefited the most from the policy. For others, in contrast, the returns of European investment on cohesion have been below expectations (Boldrin & Canova, 2001; Dall'erba & Le Gallo, 2008; Mohl & Hagen, 2010) and often conditional on the type of intervention and the characteristics of the receiving region (e.g., Dall'erba & Le Gallo, 2007, 2008; Ederveen, Groot, & Nahuis, 2006; Falk & Sinabell, 2008; Mohl & Hagen, 2010). The stark reality is that while some regions and cities have thrived—frequently becoming highly networked, technology-intensive and creative—some have endured far bumpier rides, while others have fared much worse and are, in some extreme cases, grappling with strong decline. The presence of highly dynamic winning cities and regions alongside areas that have seen long-term economic decay and are increasingly regarded as places with scarce economic opportunities is creating a ""geography of discontent"" (Dijkstra, Poelman, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2019; Los, McCann, Springford, & Thissen, 2017; McCann, 2020; Rodríguez-Pose, 2018). This ""geography of discontent"" is currently having significant economic, social and political implications. As indicated by The Economist on 17 December 2016, rising subnational inequality ""is proving too politically dangerous to ignore."" Hence, understanding why these divergences occur is one of the principal dilemmas confronting the social sciences today: why do seemingly identical or very similar regions and cities sometimes perform so differently? Or, put in another way, what are the key factors that affect the economic fortunes of territories? This paper will look at why our theoretical toolbox is increasingly failing when trying to explain the economic trajectories of regions and cities and how a greater focus on how institutions, governance and government quality shape economic activity may not only allow us to explain better the differences in the economic performances of territories, but also provide the basis for a sounder and more efficient development policy at subnational level. In order to do that, I will first look at the ""problem,"" namely why are we struggling to adequately comprehend the diverse economic trajectories of cities and regions. Then I will identify what I consider to be a number of critical gaps in our knowledge, before turning to the analysis of institutions as a potential solution to the ""problem."" The penultimate section of the paper will outline potential ways forward in order to improve both our understanding of what triggers economic development as well as the design, delivery and implementation of development policies. The conclusions are presented in final section. If scientific research has struggled to properly understand why some territories fail while others thrive, the answer may lay in the deficiencies in our theoretical toolbox and how they have affected development policy interventions in cities and regions. In recent years it has become increasingly clear that we are witnessing a decline in the returns of intervention in the three traditional main growth axes. There is, for example, concern about a potential exhaustion of additional investments in transport infrastructure and of improvements in accessibility as drivers of growth (Crescenzi, Di Cataldo, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2016; Crescenzi & Rodríguez-Pose, 2012). There is also growing scepticism about the viability and returns of investing in technology and innovation in areas that are far away from the technological frontier (Acemoglu, Aghion, & Zilibotti, 2006; Farole et al., 2011; Filippetti & Peyrache, 2015). Furthermore, distance to the technological frontier may also affect the economic impact of investment in human capital (Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019; Sterlacchini, 20082008; Vandenbussche, Aghion, & Meghir, 2006). Overall, the combination of physical capital, human capital, and technology explains a waning share of the variation in territorial—regional and urban—development. Economic theories that accounted for differences in development performance relatively well two decades ago are becoming less capable of doing so (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). The residual factor is growing, meaning that, in spite of substantial improvements in growth theory, methods and data availability, we tend to be able to explain less about what determines the fortunes of territories. This declining explanatory capacity signals that a key ingredient in the growth and development equation has been missing. Especially at the empirical level, ""stubbornly high—and often growing—residuals in growth regressions have encouraged many scholars to look for additional factors that impinge on economic development and growth beyond traditional growth theories"" (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013, p. 1036). Most eyes have turned to the role of institutions, in general, and government quality, in particular, for answers (Charron, Dijkstra, & Lapuente, 2014, 2015). Indeed, according to Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004), institutions trump traditional factors such as trade, resource endowments, and geography in their significance and influence on economic development. However, although the literature concerning the role of institutions for development is becoming more voluminous and transcends numerous academic disciplines, scholarly research is labouring to go beyond the idea that ""institutions matter."" Hence, how institutions shape economic progress still remains the ""dark matter"" of economic development (Storper, 2010). There are several areas where the literature on the links between institutions and development has faced considerable stumbling blocks. First and most importantly, work trying to link institutional quality to economic development has been confronted with the issue that defining institutions is difficult and remains fraught with controversy. Concepts about institutions are subjective when not outright contentious (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Second, measuring and operationalizing the institutional dimension is problematic for several reasons: (i) many different types of institutions are context and geography specific and what is an efficient institutional arrangement in one place may not necessarily work in another (Chang, 2003); (ii) time also affects the returns of specific institutional arrangements (Storper, 2005); (iii) institutions and development also tend to be endogenous: good institutions promote development and development, in turn, promotes institutional improvements (Chang, 2011; Rodrik, 2004); and (iv) institutions are also closely connected to the three other determinants of growth and with innovation and education, in particular (Glaeser, La Porta, López-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 2004). These difficulties make measuring and operationalizing institutions, especially at the regional and urban level, particularly problematic. Despite these notable barriers, considerable progress has been made of late in terms of measuring institutions and their impact at subnational level in different parts of the world (e.g., Beer & Lester, 2015, for Australia; Rodríguez-Pose & Zhang, 2019, 2020 and Wang, 2019, for China), but particularly in Europe. The Quality of Government Institute of the University of Gothenburg has made the largest contribution in this respect. The Quality of Government Institute generated, at the request of the European Commission, a comprehensive subjective quality of government (QoG) index for virtually all regions of Europe (Charron, Lapuente, & Rothstein, 2011; Charron et al., 2014). This index has now been produced in three waves: 2010, 2013 and 2017. It became an instant hit since its release, with several researchers resorting to it as the main indicator of institutional quality across regions of Europe. The common the nominator of most of the studies using this index is that institutional quality is a fundamental factor in explaining not only the economic growth trajectories, but also innovation, productivity or employment across regions of Europe. The consensus is that institutional quality matters, and that it matters a lot (e.g., Ketterer & Rodríguez-Pose, 2018), as an explanation of the divergent economic paths of subnational territories in virtually all economic realms. Public institutions are, according to Morgan (2017, p. 571), ""needed to broker connections and nurture novelty."" More specifically, institutional quality determines the capacity of regions and cities to compete in a more economically integrated world (Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013; Huggins, Izushi, Prokop, & Thompson, 2014). It drives differences in employment growth and social inclusion (Di Cataldo and Rodríguez-Pose, 2017), as well as in entrepreneurship (Audretsch & Belitski, 2017; Fritsch & Wyrwich, 2018; Huggins & Thompson, 2016; Nistotskaya, Charron, & Lapuente, 2015; Wyrwich, Stuetzer, & Sternberg, 2016) and innovation capacity (Rodríguez-Pose & Di Cataldo, 2015; Sleuwaegen & Boiardi, 2014). Local institutional conditions also determine environmental responses to climate challenges (Halkos, Sundström, & Tzeremes, 2015) and shape the participation of individuals in politics and policy (Sundström & Wängnerud, 2014). As importantly, on top of the above-mentioned direct effects, differences in institutional quality across subnational territories have weighty indirect implications on the effectiveness of other policies. They, for example, shape the returns of development and/or cohesion intervention (Glückler & Lenz, 2016; Rodríguez-Pose & Garcilazo, 2015), influence the choice of public goods—as, for example, the different types of transport infrastructure investments pursued in different places (Crescenzi et al., 2016). They also condition the economic impact of political processes, such as decentralization (Muringani, Fitjar, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2019) and determine, to a large extent, how attractive a territory is for potential migrants (Ketterer & Rodríguez-Pose, 2015). Overall, differences in institutional quality across territories can be considered today as important as—if not more important than—variations in physical and human capital endowments and innovation capacity for the economic development of cities and regions (Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019). All this recent work on how institutions and government quality affect development strategies and, consequently, the economic performance of territories represents a substantial progress in our understanding of the role of institutions as shapers of economic development at subnational level and, especially, in lagging areas. However—and in spite of the progress made—this research continues to be highly divided (see, for example, the contrasts in Acemoglu and Johnson's (2005) approach vs. that of Chang (2011)—and remains limited on a number of counts. First, recent work has generally regarded institutional conditions as a static factor. The quality of local institutions is considered to be fundamentally a result of history (Charron & Lapuente, 2013). Institutions are built on decades, if not centuries of history, and, therefore, for many they can hardly be changed through policy intervention. They are path dependent and generally assumed to be a permanent feature of a territory. If the South of Italy has underperformed the rest of the country for now several centuries, it is because of the institutional divergence that took place between the North and the South of Italy in the Middle Ages (Putnam, 1993). Hence, institutions are often regarded as permanent features of a territory that facilitate or impede the adequate development of economic activity. Yet, institutional quality does not always remain still. It can change and, under specific circumstances, the transformation can take place swiftly (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006), often through processes linked to agency (Grillitsch & Sotarauta, 2019). Many Central and Eastern European countries, cities and regions improved their institutional quality rather rapidly after the fall of communism. Others, by contrast, did not. Despite some exceptions (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019), the capacity for institutions to change and, accordingly, transform the economic potential of a place has been generally neglected by research to date. Second, most analyses of the role of institutions on economic development have tended to put the emphasis on formal institutions often at the expense of informal institutions. The rule of law or property rights, for example, have featured prominently in most seminal empirical institutional studies (e.g., Acemoglu & Johnson, 2005; Rodrik et al., 2004), while the interest on informal institutions—such as values, culture, trust, openness, networks, tolerance, diversity, creativity or social capital—has considerably lagged behind. This is something that is difficult to understand, especially as the quality of data on values and social capital has kept on improving in recent decades. The few exceptions in this respect (e.g., Beugelsdijk & Klasing, 2016; Beugelsdijk, Klasing, & Milionis, 2019; Cortinovis, Xiao, Boschma, & van Oort, 2017) provide interesting insights, but still fall far short of the attention that the role of informal institutions for economic development deserves. Third, most subnational research has limited itself to establishing whether institutions matter or not for economic development. However, limited attention has been paid to the exact transmission mechanisms through which institutions affect economic outcomes. Hence, we know relatively little about the ways in which different types of formal and informal institutions affect the economic development of cities and regions. Last but not least, there is still a long way to go in order to transform research on the impact of institutions on economic development at subnational level into effective, evidence-based policies. While there is an increasing recognition of the institutional dimension in development policies and of the importance of mitigating and minimizing the potential for institutionally-related failures, there is still considerable scope to both incorporate place-sensitive institutional reforms and capacity-building initiatives into the development strategies themselves, based on more detailed research of the dynamics and mechanisms at play between institutional factors and development outcomes. Institutions are fundamental for the development of economic activities: they are the rules that govern (North, 1990) and promote (Nelson & Nelson, 2002) human interaction and economic change. Recent research has tended to highlight the fact that institutions matter for economic development, but, most of this research has paid more attention to institutional stability 1 and less to the processes of change (Scott, 2013). Indeed, according to Chang (2011) the dominant views on the link between institutions and development have overlooked the importance of institutional change. Hence, whether institutional change affects the economic performance of cities and regions in Europe and elsewhere remains, to a large extent, underexplored. Do institutional improvements affect economic development at subnational level in any significant way? Do poor institutional endowments represent an unsurmountable barrier for economic development, especially in less developed regions and cities as hinted by past research (e.g., Putnam, 1993)? Dealing with these questions at subnational level implies far more research than the limited analyses conducted to date (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019). There is a need to assess whether both the initial levels and the degree of institutional change affect regional and urban economic performance in the same way within countries and across different geographies (e.g., Grillitsch, 2015). Particular emphasis is required to determine how institutions co-evolve (Gong & Hassink, 2019) and how institutional change determines economic performance in lagging regions, those that traditionally have a weaker institutional ecosystem. In this respect it is essential to discriminate between the role played by traditional areas in development policy intervention, such as infrastructure, human capital and innovation, relative to that of different formal and informal institutional aspects, such as corruption, openness, social capital, tolerance, the rule of law, government effectiveness and government accountability. The focus has to fall squarely on changes in all these factors. Moreover, the analysis of the dynamics of institutional change needs to rise above considering regions and cities as uniform. It has to start differentiating between territories, using the whole spectrum of cities and regions, in a way that takes into account their unique characteristics (e.g., European Commission, 2014). We need to know more about whether improving institutional quality by either increasing social capital and tolerance, reducing widespread corruption, cultivating human capital and fostering absorptive capacity, or introducing measures aimed at making government decisions more efficient and transparent represents as important a requisite for territorial development at subnational level as conducting more traditional ""hard"" types of regional development investments (Malecki, 2012). We also need to know more about what determines the emergence of able and effective local leaders (Beer & Clower, 2014). Future research, therefore, will have to dig deeper into whether measures aimed at reducing the monopoly power of bureaucrats (Bardhan, 1997; Rose-Ackerman, 1978) or creating a more adequate incentive pay structure for public administration (Bardhan, 1997; Tanzi, 1998) pay off; into whether e-government initiatives and a wider use of ICTs in government can also deliver improvements in government efficiency and transparency (Pina, Torres, & Royo, 2007); whether cutting red-tape (Håkanson, 2013), as well as measures aimed at increasing the education levels of civil servants can further redress public sector inefficiencies and promote economic growth (Afonso, Schuknecht, & Tanzi, 2010); or whether increasing tolerance and openness triggers economic development (Florida, Mellander, & Stolarick, 2008). We also need to know more about how can different places break out of current practices and improve their institutional conditions. There is often the perception that local institutional conditions are sticky and take a very long time—often centuries—to change, (e.g., Putnam, 1993). This generates an institutional path dependency, resulting in lock-in in a large number of places. However, changes can also take place in relatively short periods. In the European context, for example, the rapid recent improvements of institutions in a country like Estonia strongly contrast with stasis, rigidity, and reluctance to change in Italy. Hence, there is a need to better comprehend the dynamics of change, taking both into account the starting institutional—both formal and informal—conditions as well as the dynamic of different groups within a society and the balance between bonding and bridging relationships. As indicated by Rodríguez-Pose and Storper (2006, p. 15), ""places with strong groups and strong societies will be characterized by institutional arrangements with problem-solving mechanisms that help to resolve tensions and agency problems."" Yet, there is a need to know more and the division between institutional environment, which refers to higher levels institutions such as identity or culture, and institutional arrangements, touching place-specific customs and habits (Martin, 2000; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Likewise, appraising whether institutional progress, such as the enactment of public legislation and implementing policy measures aimed at improving the efficiency of government, enhancing voice and accountability, and/or reducing corruption can lead to better public interventions, characterized by a more efficient use of public expenditure, in general, and public investment, in particular (Afonso & Fernandes, 2006), represents a vital avenue for future research. However, this implies acknowledging that institutional bottlenecks are at the heart of development problems and adequately recognizing the role played by institutional quality in development (Tanzi, 1998). Institutional quality must then be raised to the rank of a fundamental factor in growth equations, on a par with transport infrastructure, education and training, and technology and innovation. However, as Persson, Rothstein, and Teorell (2013) stress, awareness of the problem alone is not sufficient and an in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms behind institutional change and how it affects urban and regional economic performance is required as an initial step to be able to formulate solid, evidence-based policies. Formal institutions generally refer to institutions that are defined by ""transparent and codified rules"" (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006, p. 2). As such, they are universal, transferable, and determine human interaction (North, 1990; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). The quality of formal institutions therefore has the potential to significantly affect economic development (Acemoglu & Johnson; 2005; Charron, Dijkstra, & Lapuente, 2014; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Informal institutions generally refer ""to features of group life, such as norms, traditions and social conventions, interpersonal contacts, relationships, and informal networks"" (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006, p. 1). In the same way as formal institutions, informal institutions can play a central role in determining economic development (e.g., Duranton, Rodríguez-Pose, & Sandall, 2009; Florida et al., 2008; Putnam, 1993; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013; Tabellini, 2010). However, due to difficulties in defining and operationalizing informal institutions (Lee, 2017), the research focusing on how informal institutions influence economic performance at subnational level is much more limited than that dealing with formal institutions. While there is no shortage of academic work on issues such as how differences in the power awarded to subnational governments (e.g., Marks, Hooghe, & Schakel, 2008; Rodríguez-Pose & Ezcurra, 2011) or in government quality (e.g., Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013; Charron et al., 2014; Nistotskaya et al., 2015; Rodríguez-Pose & Di Cataldo, 2015; Rodríguez-Pose & Garcilazo, 2015) shape different aspects of subnational competitiveness in Europe, the focus on the role of informal institutions is still mostly absent. Hence, examining how informal institutions impinge on urban and regional performance at a subnational level would address a fundamental gap in our knowledge. Economic interaction and progress is highly dependent on the specific informal institutional conditions of the context in which the economic activity takes place (Cortinovis et al., 2017; Lee, 2017; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013; Tabellini, 2010). Local levels of diversity, openness, trust and tolerance—among other factors—determine to a large extent what type of economic activity occurs in a specific place and affect its innovativeness, creativity, and productivity (Florida et al., 2008; Kemeny & Cooke, 2017). Yet, the empirical studies that have aimed to assess the link between informal institutions—from family structures to culture—and economic development (e.g., Cortinovis et al., 2017; Duranton et al., 2009; Tabellini, 2010) remain scarce. Two types of questions require urgent answers. First of all, to what extent do informal institutions shape urban and regional economic development? Do they do it in a similar way as formal institutions? Or do they follow different paths? Second, it is crucial to understand how do formal and informal institutions interact in specific subnational territories in order to generate economic development, as formal and informal institutions ""are mutually influential in shaping a variety of [economic] outcomes"" (Storper, 2014, p. 117).

To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups. Researchers should consider the implications of changing race and Hispanic origin responses when conducting analyses and interpreting results.",University of Minnesota System,University of Minnesota,University of Minnesota,"census bureau, bureau","Race (biology), Census, Ethnic group, Native Hawaiians, Demography, Pacific islanders, Population, Churning, Geography, Gerontology, Medicine, Gender studies, Sociology, Labour economics, Economics, Anthropology"
An outside view: What do observers say about others’ races and Hispanic origins?,2017,[],Sonya Rastogi; CAROLYN LIEBLER; James Noon,Sonya Rastogi; CAROLYN LIEBLER; James Noon,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xeqne,"Outsiders’ views of a person’s race or Hispanic origin can impact how she sees herself, how she reports her race and Hispanic origins, and her social and economic experiences. The way outsiders describe non-strangers in terms of their race and Hispanic origin may reveal popular assumptions about which race/Hispanic categories are salient for Americans, which kinds of people are seen as multiracial, and the types of cues people use when identifying another person’s race. We study patterns of observer identification using a unique, large, linked data source with two measures of a person’s race and Hispanic origin. One measure (from Census 2000 or the 2010 Census) was provided by a household respondent and the other (from the other census year) was provided by a census proxy reporter (e.g., a neighbor) who responded on behalf of a non-responsive household. We ask: Does an outsider’s report of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match a household report? We find that in about 90% of our 3.7 million (nonrepresentative) cases, proxy reports of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match responses given by the household in a different census year. Match rates are high for the largest groups: non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians and for Hispanics, though proxies are not very able to replicate the race responses of Hispanics. Matches are much less common for people in smaller groups (American Indian/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, Some Other Race, and multiracial). We also ask: What predicts a matched response and what predicts a particular unmatched response? We find evidence of the persistence of hypodescent for blacks and hyperdescent for American Indians. Biracial Asian-whites and Pacific Islander-whites are more often seen by others as non-Hispanic white than as people of color. Proxy reporters tend to identify children as multiple race and elders as single race, whether they are or not. The race/Hispanic composition of the tract is more powerfully predictive of a particular unmatched response than are tract-level measures of socioeconomic status; unmatched responses are often consistent with the race/Hispanic characteristics of the neighborhood.",University of Minnesota; United States Census Bureau; University of Minnesota System,"University of Minnesota; Bureau Center for Administrative Records Research and Applications U.S. Census Bureau Washington, D.C. 20233; University of Minnesota James M.

"Kinship, Cooperation, and the Evolution of Moral Systems*",2019,[],Benjamin Enke,Benjamin Enke,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz001,"Across the social sciences, a key question is how societies manage to enforce cooperative behavior in social dilemmas such as public goods provision or bilateral trade. According to an influential body of theories in psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, the answer is that humans have evolved moral systems: packages of functional psychological and biological mechanisms that regulate economic behavior, including a belief in moralizing gods; moral values; negative reciprocity; and emotions of shame, guilt, and disgust. Based on a stylized model, this article empirically studies the structure and evolution of these moral traits as a function of historical heterogeneity in extended kinship relationships. The evidence shows that societies with a historically tightly knit kinship structure regulate behavior through communal moral values, revenge taking, emotions of external shame, and notions of purity and disgust. In loose kinship societies, on the other hand, cooperation appears to be enforced through universal moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and an apparent rise and fall of moralizing religions. These patterns point to the presence of internally consistent but culturally variable functional moral systems. Consistent with the model, the relationship between kinship ties, economic development, and the structure of the mediating moral systems amplified over time.",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,"bureau, national bureau of economic research","Kinship, Shame, Disgust, Social psychology, Reciprocity (cultural anthropology), Moral disengagement, Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology, Anger"

"Inflation Dynamics: Dead, Dormant, or Determined Abroad?",2019,[],Kristin J. Forbes,Kristin J. Forbes,https://doi.org/10.1353/eca.2019.0015,"Inflation dynamics have been difficult to explain over the last decade. This paper explores whether a more comprehensive treatment of globalization can help. CPI inflation has become more synchronized around the world since the 2008 crisis, but core and wage inflation have become less synchronized. Global factors (including commodity prices, world slack, exchange rates, and global value chains) are significant drivers of CPI inflation in a cross-section of countries, and their role has increased over the last decade, particularly the role of nonfuel commodity prices. These global factors, however, do less to improve our understanding of core and wage inflation.

Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913: Evidence from Capitalized Income Tax Data *,2016,[],Emmanuel Saez; Gabriel Zucman,Emmanuel Saez; Gabriel Zucman,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjw004,"Abstract This paper combines income tax returns with macroeconomic household balance sheets to estimate the distribution of wealth in the United States since 1913. We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations’ tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1% wealth share has risen from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy’s labor income. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.","Berkeley College; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","UC BERKELEY; University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research","UC BERKELEY; University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research","bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Taxable income, Economics, National wealth, Adjusted gross income, Labour economics, Gross income, Inequality, Real estate, State income tax, Capitalization, Wealth elasticity of demand, Economic inequality, Income tax, Distribution (mathematics), Finance, Tax reform, Public economics, Mathematical analysis, Linguistics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Accounting"

Violante,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx018,"Abstract What shapes the optimal degree of progressivity of the tax and transfer system? On the one hand, a progressive tax system can counteract inequality in initial conditions and substitute for imperfect private insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. On the other hand, progressivity reduces incentives to work and to invest in skills, distortions that are especially costly when the government must finance public goods. We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preference, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the desire to finance government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting optimal progressivity. In a version of the model where poverty constrains skill investment, optimal progressivity is close to the U.S. value.

Practical and economic advantages of choice feeding systems for laying poultry,2002,[],Y L Henuk; J. G. Dingle,Y.L. Henuk; J.G. Dingle,https://doi.org/10.1079/wps20020018,"Poultry can be managed under different feeding systems, depending on the husbandry skills and the feed available. These systems include the following: (1) a complete dry feed offered as a mash ad libitum; (2) the same feed offered as pellets or crumbles ad libitum; (3) a complete feed with added whole grain; (4) a complete wet feed given once or twice a day; (5) a complete feed offered on a restricted basis; (6) choice feeding. Of all these, an interesting alternative to offering complete diets is choice feeding which can be applied on both a small or large commercial scale. Under choice feeding or ""free-choice feeding"" birds are usually offered a choice between three types of feedstuffs: (a) an energy source (e.g. maize, rice bran, sorghum or wheat); (b) a protein source (e.g. soyabean meal, meat meal, fish meal or coconut meal) plus vitamins and minerals and (c), in the case of laying hens, calcium in granular form (i.e. oyster-shell grit). This system differs from the modern commercial practice of offering a complete diet comprising energy and protein sources, ground and mixed together. Under the complete diet system, birds are mainly only able to exercise their appetite for energy. When the environmental temperature varies, the birds either over- or under-consume protein and calcium. The basic principle behind practising choice feeding with laying hens is that individual hens are able to select from the various feed ingredients on offer and compose their own diet, according to their actual needs and production capacity. A choice-feeding system is of particular importance to small poultry producers in developing countries, such as Indonesia, because it can substantially reduce the cost of feed. The system is flexible and can be constructed in such a way that the various needs of a flock of different breeds, including village chickens, under different climates can be met. The system also offers a more effective way to use home-produced grain, such as maize, and by-products, such as rice bran, in developing countries. Because oyster-shell grit is readily available in developing countries at lower cost than limestone, the use of cheaper oyster-shell grit can further benefit small-holders in these countries. These benefits apart, simpler equipment suffices when designing and building a feed mixer on the farm, and transport costs are lower. If whole (unground) grain is used, the intake of which is accompanied by increased efficiency of feed utilisation, the costs of grinding, mixing and many of the handling procedures associated with mash and pellet preparation are eliminated. The choice feedstuffs can all be offered in the current feed distribution systems, either by mixing the ingredients first or by using a bulk bin divided into three compartments.",University of Nusa Cendana; The University of Queensland,"Faculty of Agriculture, University of Nusa Cendana, New Campus, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, 85361, Indonesia; School of Animal Studies, University of Queensland, Gatton Campus, Gatton, Queensland 4345, Australia","Faculty of Agriculture, University of Nusa Cendana, New Campus, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, 85361, Indonesia; School of Animal Studies, University of Queensland, Gatton Campus, Gatton, Queensland 4345, Australia","bea, restricted, irs","Bran, Meal, Biology, Fish meal, Animal husbandry, Meat and bone meal, Ingredient, Food science, Laying, Sorghum, Pellets, Appetite, Animal feed, Animal science, Biotechnology, Agronomy, Fish <Actinopterygii>, Agriculture, Ecology, Fishery, Engineering, Raw material, Paleontology, Endocrinology, Structural engineering"

Second, the threat of an employee spinoff may prevent a firm owner from making costly, productivity-enhancing investments in their workers. Noncompete agreements (NCAs) solve both problems. From the perspective of a consumer, NCAs may increase prices by decreasing competition, but the investments made by firm owners have the potential to mitigate competitive harms. We develop a model which formally demonstrates this tradeoff to assess the impacts of NCA policy on consumers, and discuss when a ban on NCAs is most likely to be beneficial for consumers. We show that the competitive environment, the nature of investment pass-through, and the benefits of investment play large roles. Counterintuitively, increased benefits of costly investments have the potential to harm consumers, such that industries where NCAs are most important to firms may also be those where harm is greater. Finally, we draw two analogies between NCAs and antitrust (merger analysis and pay-for-delay agreements) and show how insights in those areas may inform NCA policy.",Federal Trade Commission; Miami University,Miami University; Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Economics,Miami University; Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Economics,"bureau, irs","Welfare, Business, Economics, International trade, Market economy"

Corli O. et al.Quality of cancer pain management: an update of a systematic review of undertreatment of patients with cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32: 4149-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar] using the Pain Management Index (PMI) [8.Cleeland C.S. Gonin R. Hatfield A.K. et al.Pain and its treatment in outpatients with metastatic cancer.N Engl J Med. 1994; 330: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar], approximately one-third of patients do not receive appropriate analgesia proportional to their pain intensity (PI). High prevalence has also been documented in haematology patients at diagnosis, during therapy and in the last month of life [9.Bandieri E. Sichetti D. Luppi M. et al.Is pain in patients with haematological malignancies under-recognised? The results from Italian ECAD-O survey.Leuk Res. 2010; 34: e334-e335Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. These data reinforce the recommendation that patients with advanced or metastatic cancer require management within an integrated system for palliative care [7.Greco M.T. Roberto A. Corli O. et al.Quality of cancer pain management: an update of a systematic review of undertreatment of patients with cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32: 4149-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar]. Cancer-related pain may be presented as a major issue of healthcare systems worldwide: ∼14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred worldwide in 2012, based on GLOBOCAN estimates [10.Torre L.A. Bray F. Siegel R.L. et al.Global cancer statistics, 2012.CA Cancer J Clin. 2015; 65: 87-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20769) Google Scholar] and incidence will be > 15 million in 2020, based on projections [11.Frankish H. 15 million new cancer cases per year by 2020, says WHO.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1278.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar]. Initial and ongoing assessment of pain should be an integral part of cancer care and indicates when additional comprehensive assessment is needed (Table 2). The regular self-reporting of PI with the help of validated assessment tools is the first step towards effective and individualised treatment. The most frequently used standardised scales [12.Caraceni A. Cherny N. Fainsinger R. et al.Pain measurement tools and methods in clinical research in palliative care: recommendations of an expert working group of the European Association of Palliative Care.J Pain Symptom Manage. 2002; 23: 239-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar] are reported in Figure 1 and are the visual analogue scale (VAS), the verbal rating scale (VRS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS).Table 2Guidelines for the adequate assessment of the patient with pain at any stage of the disease1. Assess and re-assess the pain Causes, onset, type, site, absence/presence of radiating pain, duration, intensity, relief and temporal patterns of the pain, number of BTcPs, pain syndrome, inferred pathophysiology, pain at rest and/or moving Presence of trigger factors and signs and symptoms associated with the pain Presence of relieving factors Use of analgesics and their efficacy and tolerability Description of the pain quality:–Aching, throbbing, pressure: often associated with somatic pain in skin, muscle and bone–Aching, cramping, gnawing, sharp: often associated with visceral pain in organs or viscera–Shooting, sharp, stabbing, tingling, ringing: often associated with NP caused by nerve damage2. Assess and re-assess the patient Clinical situation by means of a complete/specific physical examination and the specific radiological and/or biochemical investigations Interference of pain with the patient's daily activities, work, social life, sleep patterns, appetite, sexual functioning, mood, well-being and coping Impact of the pain, the disease and the therapy on the physical, psychological and social conditions Presence of a caregiver, psychological status, degree of awareness of the disease, anxiety and depression and suicidal ideation, his/her social environment, QoL, spiritual concerns/needs, problems in communication, personality disorders Presence and intensity of signs, physical and/or emotional symptoms associated with cancer pain syndromes Presence of comorbidities (i.e. diabetic, renal and/or hepatic failure, etc.) Functional status Presence of opiophobia or misconception related to pain treatment Alcohol and/or substance abuse3. Assess and re-assess your ability to inform and to communicate with the patient and the family Spend time with the patient and the family to understand their needsBTcP, breakthrough cancer pain; NP, neuropathic pain; QoL, quality of life. Open table in a new tab BTcP, breakthrough cancer pain; NP, neuropathic pain; QoL, quality of life. Assessment of the pain descriptors improves the choice of therapy. Pain can be:(i)Nociceptive: caused by ongoing tissue damage, either somatic (such as bone pain) or visceral (such as gut or hepatic pain); or(ii)Neuropathic: caused by damage or dysfunction in the nervous system, such as in brachial plexopathy or in spinal cord compression by tumour [13.Sun V. Borneman T. Piper B. et al.Barriers to pain assessment and management in cancer survivorship.J Cancer Surviv. 2008; 2: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar]. Most patients with advanced cancer have at least two types of cancer-related pain, resulting from a variety of pathophysiology [14.Portenoy R.K. Koh M. Cancer pain syndromes.in: Bruera E. Portenoy R.K. Cancer Pain. Assessment and Management. 4. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2010: 53-88Google Scholar]. Initial assessment of cancer-related pain for all patients should include:(i)Ask a key screening question, which is not paraphrased and is used consistently. That question should be: 'What has been your worst pain in the last 24 hours on a scale of 0–10?', where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable [15.Fallon M. Walker J. Colvin L. et al.Pain management in cancer center inpatients: a cluster randomized trial to evaluate a systematic integrated approach-the Edinburgh pain assessment and management tool.J Clin Oncol. 2018; 36: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar].(ii)Monitor if the pain is < 3.(iii)Move to a more detailed assessment if the worst pain is ≥ 3 or if the patient is distressed by pain (as per Table 2). This should also include average pain and pain 'right now'.(iv)Administer appropriate analgesic and reassess both pain and analgesic side effects.(v)Review analgesic regimen if side effects to prescribed analgesics are present and/or pain persists. Recommendation:•The intensity of pain and the treatment outcomes should be assessed regularly and consistently using the VAS or NRS using the question: 'What has been your worst pain in the last 24 hours?' [V, D]. In elderly patients, limited communicative skills and/or cognitive impairment make self-reporting of pain more difficult, although there is no evidence of clinical reduction in pain-related suffering. When cognitive deficits are severe, observation of pain-related behaviours and discomfort (e.g. facial expression, body movements, verbalisation or vocalisations, changes in interpersonal interactions, changes in routine activity) is an alternative strategy for assessing the presence of pain (but not its intensity) [16.van Herk R. van Dijk M. Baar F.P.M. et al.Observational scales for pain assessment in older adults with cognitive impairments or communication difficulties.Nurs Res. 2007; 56: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar]. Observational scales are available [16.van Herk R. van Dijk M. Baar F.P.M. et al.Observational scales for pain assessment in older adults with cognitive impairments or communication difficulties.Nurs Res. 2007; 56: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar]; however, none is validated in different languages. Sensitivity to a light touch can signal neuropathic pain (NP). A detailed appraisal of the literature pertaining to pain assessment in patients with cognitive impairment is outside the scope of this guideline but, given the global challenge and projected increase in dementia, this will become increasingly important [17.Lichtner V. Dowding D. Esterhuizen P. et al.Pain assessment for people with dementia: a systematic review of systematic reviews of pain assessment tools.BMC Geriatr. 2014; 14: 138.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Assessment and management of pain in children are not considered in this manuscript, but guidelines have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [18.World Health Organization. WHO Guidelines on the Pharmacological Treatment of Persisting Pain in Children with Medical Illnesses, 2012. www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/guide_perspainchild/en/ (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar]. Recommendation:•Observation of pain-related behaviours and discomfort is indicated in patients with cognitive impairment to assess the presence of pain [V, C]. Psychosocial distress is strongly associated with cancer pain and should be assessed [19.Syrjala K.L. Jensen M.P. Mendoza M.E. et al.Psychological and behavioural approaches to cancer pain management.J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Psychological distress may amplify pain and similarly, inadequately controlled pain may cause psychological distress [20.Tracey I. Neuroimaging mechanisms in pain: from discovery to translation.Pain. 2017; 158: S115-S122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Recommendation:•The assessment of all components of suffering, such as psychosocial distress, should be considered and evaluated [II, B]. Patients must be informed about possible onset of pain at any stage of the disease, both during/after diagnostic interventions and as a consequence of cancer and/or anticancer treatments. Patients should be empowered and encouraged to communicate with the physician and/or the nurse about their suffering, the efficacy of therapy and side effects. Patient education should include information on the appropriate use of opioids; this should be set in context with other analgesic and non-pharmacological approaches [21.Reid C.M. Gooberman-Hill R. Hanks G.W. Opioid analgesics for cancer pain: symptom control for the living or comfort for the dying? A qualitative study to investigate the factors influencing the decision to accept morphine for pain caused by cancer.Ann Oncol. 2008; 19: 44-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. Patient involvement in pain management improves both communication and pain relief through enhancing both patient understanding and physician assessment and prescribing [22.Bennett M.I. Bagnall A.M. José Closs S. How effective are patient-based educational interventions in the management of cancer pain? Systematic review and meta-analysis.Pain. 2009; 143: 192-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23.Sheinfeld Gorin S. Krebs P. Badr H. et al.Meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions to reduce pain in patients with cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2012; 30: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar]. It is important to prescribe a therapy that can be managed simply by patients and families themselves. The oral route, if well tolerated, should be considered as the preferred route of administration [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar, 25.Hanks G.W. De Conno F. Ripamonti C. et al.Morphine in cancer pain: modes of administration.BMJ. 1996; 312: 823-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), defined as 'a transitory flare of pain that occurs on a background of relatively well-controlled baseline pain', requires careful assessment and appropriate management. Typical BTcP episodes are of moderate to severe intensity, rapid in onset (minutes) and of relatively short duration (median 30 minutes) [26.Portenoy R.K. Hagen N.A. Breakthrough pain: definition, prevalence, and characteristics.Pain. 1990; 41: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•Patients should be informed about pain and pain management and should be encouraged to take an active role in their pain management [II, B].•The onset of pain should be prevented by means of around-the-clock (ATC) administration, taking into account the half-life, bioavailability and duration of action of different drugs [II, B].•Analgesics for chronic pain should be prescribed on a regular basis and not on an 'as required' schedule [V, D].•The oral route of administration of analgesic drugs should be advocated as the first choice [IV, C]. The type and dose of analgesic drugs are influenced by the PI and must be promptly adjusted to reach a balance between optimal pain relief and minimum side effects. Rescue doses [as-needed (prn) doses] should be prescribed proactively for the relief of BTcP pain and to overcome end-of-dose failure. Rescue medication used for end-of-dose failure should help with calculating the daily titration of regular doses. The oral route is preferred except when oral intake is not possible because of severe vomiting, bowel obstruction, severe dysphagia or severe confusion, and in the case of poor pain control which requires rapid dose escalation and/or in the presence of oral opioid-related adverse effects. The WHO proposes a strategy (currently under review) for cancer pain treatment based on a sequential three-step analgesic ladder, from non-opioids to weak opioids to strong opioids, according to PI [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar]. The WHO ladder recommends non-opioid analgesics as possible options at all steps; however, this is of greater relevance for the first two steps of the WHO ladder. In practical terms, this means paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (step 1). Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of analgesic therapy and are classified according to ability to control pain from mild to moderate (step 2) to moderate to severe intensity (step 3) [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar, 25.Hanks G.W. De Conno F. Ripamonti C. et al.Morphine in cancer pain: modes of administration.BMJ. 1996; 312: 823-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Portenoy R.K. Hagen N.A. Breakthrough pain: definition, prevalence, and characteristics.Pain. 1990; 41: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar]. However, some authors have suggested eliminating the second step of the analgesic ladder, with weak opioids being replaced with low doses of oral morphine [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Fallon M. Do We Need Step 2 of the WHO Pain Ladder—An EAPC Research Network Study. EAPC Abstract Book. EAPC, Madrid2017Google Scholar]. Analgesic drugs are only one part of cancer pain management, and an integrated approach to cancer pain management should be adopted; this should incorporate:(i)primary antitumour treatments;(ii)interventional analgesic therapy and(iii)a variety of non-invasive techniques such as psychological and rehabilitative interventions [29.Paice J.A. Ferrell B. The management of cancer pain.CA Cancer J Clin. 2011; 61: 157-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar]. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are universally accepted as part of the treatment of cancer pain at any stage of the WHO analgesic ladder. Several relevant systematic reviews are available regarding the efficacy of paracetamol and NSAIDs for cancer pain management, either when used alone or in combination with opioids. Paracetamol is the mainstay of the first two steps of the WHO analgesic ladder in many countries. However, a Cochrane systematic review highlights the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of paracetamol for cancer pain [30.Wiffen P.J. Derry S. Moore R.A. et al.Oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 7: CD012637PubMed Google Scholar]. In 2017, Cochrane identified 11 studies of oral NSAIDs in adults with cancer pain [31.Derry S. Wiffen P.J. Moore R. et al.Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer pain in adults.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 12: CD012638Google Scholar]. These included 949 participants; however, no studies examined the effects of NSAIDs together with an opioid (such as morphine), although this is how they are often used. All studies were compromised by small numbers. With any NSAID, moderate or severe cancer pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain in 26%–51% of patients, after 1 or 2 weeks in 4 of the 11 studies. Based on this 2017 Cochrane review, there is no conclusive evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the treatment of mild cancer pain. (There is limited evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within 1 or 2 weeks.) It is important to monitor and reassess the long-term use of NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors [32.British National Formulary. BNF 75 March–September 2018, 75th edition. London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2018.Google Scholar] because of their significant toxicity (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet dysfunction and renal failure). COX-2 selective inhibitors may increase the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular adverse reactions [33.European Medicines Agency. Public statement: European Medicines Agency Announces Regulatory Action on COX-2 Inhibitors (EMEA/62838/2005). www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/11/WC500014818.pdf (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar] and do not reduce the risk of renal failure. Dipyrone is another non-opioid analgesia that a recent systematic review concluded could be used for the treatment of cancer pain, alone or in combination with opioids [34.Gaertner J. Stamer U.M. Remi C. et al.Metamizole/dipyrone for the relief of cancer pain: a systematic review and evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.Palliat Med. 2017; 31: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•Analgesic treatment should start with drugs indicated by the WHO analgesic ladder appropriate for the severity of pain [II, B].•There is no significant evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for mild to moderate pain [I, C].•There is no significant evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for mild to moderate pain [I, C]. There are few options to treat mild to moderate cancer pain before moving to strong opioids such as morphine. Tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine are the widely available options. There is widespread use of tramadol in palliative care, even though the data on its use are limited and adverse effects can be severe [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35.Wiffen P.J. Derry S. Moore R.A. Tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 5: CD012508.PubMed Google Scholar, 36.World Health Organization. WHO Model List of Essential Medicines: 20th WHO Essential Medicines List (EML), March 2017. www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/ (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar]. Tramadol has a potential role on step 2 of the analgesic ladder, particularly if other step 2 drugs are not tolerated, but adequate studies comparing tramadol with other step 2 drugs (e.g. codeine or dihydrocodeine) are missing. Tramadol can have significant side effects, such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and constipation [37.Rodriguez R.F. Bravo L.E. Castro F. et al.Incidence of weak opioids adverse events in the management of cancer pain: a double-blind comparative trial.J Palliat Med. 2007; 10: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar]. Tramadol affects serotonin metabolism or availability, potentially leading to serotonin toxicity, particularly in the elderly, and can lower seizure thresholds. Tramadol has a much-reduced analgesic effect in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) poor metabolisers. Dihydrocodeine is also a substrate for CYP2D6; its partial metabolism is limited in poor metabolisers and is blocked by CYP2D6 inhibitors. However, there is no evidence that such inhibition reduces its analgesic effect. Codeine has no or little analgesic effect until metabolised to morphine, mainly via CYP2D6. In poor metabolisers, it is therefore essentially ineffective, while in ultrarapid metabolisers, it is potentially toxic. The second step of the WHO ladder has several controversial aspects. The first criticism concerns the absence of a definitive proof of efficacy of weak opioids. A meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed no significant difference between the effectiveness of non-opioid analgesics alone and non-opioids in combination with weak opioids [38.Eisenberg E. Berkey C. Carr D.B. et al.Efficacy and safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for cancer pain: a meta-analysis.J Clin Oncol. 1994; 12: 2756-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. The available studies do not demonstrate a clear difference in the effectiveness of the drugs between the first and the second step [39.Management of cancer pain evidence report technology assessment: number 35–management of cancer pain summary.J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother. 2002; 16: 91-102Google Scholar]. A 2014 Cochrane review of weak opioids in cancer pain including 15 studies with 721 participants, although providing newer data, was not able to help formulate recommendations [40.Straube C. Derry S. Jackson K.C. et al.Codeine, alone and with paracetamol (acetaminophen), for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014; 9: CD006601Google Scholar]. The available evidence indicates that codeine is more effective against cancer pain in adults than placebo, but with increased risk of nausea, vomiting and constipation [41.Larkin P.J. Cherny N.I. La Carpia D. et al.Diagnosis, assessment and management of constipation in advanced cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.Annal Oncol. 2018; 29: iv94-iv108Google Scholar]. Work is evolving in the exploration of the place of step 2 in the WHO three-step ladder. Historical work with uncontrolled studies showed that the effectiveness of the second step of the WHO ladder has a time limit of 30–40 days for most patients and that the shift to the third step is mainly due to insufficient analgesia, and 'ceiling effect' with weak opioids, rather than to adverse effects [42.Ventafridda V. Tamburini M. Caraceni A. et al.A validation study of the WHO method for cancer pain relief.Cancer. 1987; 59: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar]. Given the lack of data on effectiveness of tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine on cancer pain, many authors have proposed the abolition of the second step of the WHO analgesic ladder, in favour of the early use of morphine at low doses, which is not in the current WHO guideline. The evidence base is evolving, with one study in favour of a low-dose morphine approach already reported and results from another RCT expected shortly [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Fallon M. Do We Need Step 2 of the WHO Pain Ladder—An EAPC Research Network Study. EAPC Abstract Book. EAPC, Madrid2017Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•For mild to moderate pain, weak opioids such as tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine can be given in combination with non-opioid analgesics [III, C].•As an alternative to weak opioids, low doses of strong opioids could be an option, although this recommendation is not currently part of WHO guidance [II, C].•There is no evidence of increase in adverse effects from the use of low-dose strong opioids instead of the standard step 2 approach with weak opioids [II, C]. Strong opioids are the mainstay of analgesic therapy in treating moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Although a variety of strong opioids exist and there is no superiority of one over another, morphine is the most widely available and prescribed. In spite of the global agreement that access to opioids is essential, both access to and use of opioids remains poor in many countries. Various factors contribute to poor access and use, which is still problematic in Eastern and South Eastern Europe [43.Manjiani D. Paul D.B.

Beyond Subordination vs. Resistance: An Intersectional Approach to the Agency of Veiled Muslim Women,2010,[],Sirma Bilge,Sirma Bilge,https://doi.org/10.1080/07256860903477662,"Abstract Engaging with a figure that came to operate as a powerful cultural signifier of otherness in debates over migrant/Muslim integration across the West, the 'veiled woman'; the paper questions the idea of agency that inheres in the contemporary feminist discourses on Muslim veil. After showing the shortcomings and adverse effects of two dominant readings of the Muslim veil, as a symbol of women's subordination to men, or as an act of resistance to Western hegemony, it explores an alternative avenue drawing on both the poststructuralist critique of the humanist subject and feminist intersectional theorising to answer the question of what kind of conception of agency can help us to think about the agency of the veiled woman without binding a priori the meaning of her veiling to the teleology of emancipation, whether feminist or anti-imperialist.

Unlike the women's movements which had to deal, for several decades now, with hegemonic uses of the 'women's question' to legitimise colonial domination and exclusion of racialised minorities from citizenship, for the global LGBT/queer movements the incorporation of their 'cause' and rhetoric into the sexual and racial politics of the Western nationalism and imperialism represents a new political moment. See CitationPuar. 2. Much of the literature uses synonymously veil, hijab and headscarf, which are distinguished from other forms of more covering Islamic dress such as jilbab, niqab and burqa. I conform to this use. 3. One notorious formulation of this antagonistic frame is CitationOkin's 'multiculturalism vs. Feminism'. 4. For a recent questioning of agency in the context of religious submission, see Mack; Hollywood (""Gender""); Avishai; Bracke; and the groundbreaking work of Mahmood, offering an invaluable critique of the conflation of agency with resistance, which remains, unlike the subordination frame, largely uncontested. 5. Alternative Biblical and Quranic reinterpretations proposed by feminist theologians aim precisely to reappropriate religion. 6. For the Habermasian feminist philosopher Seyla Benhabib, feminism cannot afford to adopt the rhetoric of the 'death of the subject' and reject notions such as agency, autonomy and selfhood (Mackenzie and Stoljar 28). Departing from the orthodox humanism relying on the Kantian conception of the subject as independent from the social world, and hence capable of being the sole author of her own actions, Benhabib's liberal approach to agency sees humans as profoundly situated, embedded in social life and discourse which condition their personhood and agency. Yet her situated subject constituted through a complex net of social relations still bears the trace of pre-discursive self (however small), which remains the source of agency (CitationBarvosa-Carter 125). 7. Michèle André, the Secretary of State for Women's Rights declared: ""adolescent girls should not become the object of controversies that are beyond them, and the Republican school should not be submitted to religious pressures of fathers and brothers"" (""Affaire"" 14). 8. From an anthropological perspective, the native/indigenous informant is an intercultural mediator translating her culture for the researcher/outsider, hence the term 'cultural insider'. 9.

I draw here on stimulating conceptualisations by CitationCollins (299), who defines it as ""the overall organization of hierarchical power relations for any society"" having ""(1) a particular arrangement of intersecting systems of oppression, e.g. race, social class, gender […]; and (2) a particular organization of its domains of power, e.g. structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal"". 12. Yet we should remind that the Butlerian approach's capacity to transcend the subordination/resistance frame has been called into question, because of her propensity to read as politically positive resistant/subversive resignification processes, for instance, agencies. See CitationHollywood (""Performativity"" 107) and Mahmood (19–22). 13. CitationPritchard (278) makes a similar claim in her materialist account of 'relative agency'. I prefer the term 'intersectional agency', for I specifically attempt to bring the normative and empirical insights of intersectionality to supplement the poststructuralist conception. 14. As pointed out by CitationMcNay (191), Butler herself acknowledged this lack in her work.

COVID-19 exacerbating inequalities in the US,2020,[],Aaron van Dorn; Rebecca Cooney; Miriam Lewis Sabin,Aaron van Dorn; Rebecca E Cooney; Miriam L Sabin,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30893-x,"COVID-19 does not affect everyone equally. In the US, it is exposing inequities in the health system. Aaron van Dorn, Rebecca E Cooney, and Miriam L Sabin report from New York. In the US, New York City has so far borne the brunt of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with the highest reported number of cases and the highest death toll in the country. The first COVID-19 case in the city was reported on March 1, but community transmission was firmly established on March 7. As of April 14, New York State has tested nearly half a million people, among whom 195 031 have tested positive. In New York City alone, 106 763 people have tested positive and 7349 have died. “New York is the canary in the coal mine. What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California, and Washington State and Illinois. It's just a matter of time”, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, while asking for greater federal assistance. The response within New York City, known for its historically strong public health responses, has been to ramp up for the surge, but also to tailor the approach to address some of the most basic touchpoints that could worsen health outcomes, including providing three meals a day to all New York residents in need. Oxiris Barbot, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stated, “Our primary focus at this moment has to be on keeping our city's communities safe. This means supporting the public hospitals with supplies; connecting underserved people to free access to care; and delivering health guidance through the trusted voices of community organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic will come to an end eventually, but what is needed afterward is a renewed focus to ensure that health is not a byproduct of privilege. Public health has a fundamental role to play in shaping our future to be more just and equitable.” Confirming existing disparities, within New York City and other urban centres, African American and other communities of colour have been especially affected by the COVID-10 pandemic. Across the country, deaths due to COVID-19 are disproportionately high among African Americans compared with the population overall. In Milwaukee, WI, three quarters of all COVID-19 related deaths are African American, and in St Louis, MO, all but three people who have died as a result of COVID-19 were African American. According to Sharrelle Barber of Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health (Philadelphia, PA, USA), the pre-existing racial and health inequalities already present in US society are being exacerbated by the pandemic. “Black communities, Latino communities, immigrant communities, Native American communities—we're going to bear the disproportionate brunt of the reckless actions of a government that did not take the proper precautions to mitigate the spread of this disease”, Barber said. “And that's going to be overlaid on top of the existing racial inequalities.” Part of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of colour has been structural factors that prevent those communities from practicing social distancing. Minority populations in the US disproportionally make up “essential workers” such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, and health-care workers and custodial staff. “These front-line workers, disproportionately black and brown, then are typically a part of residentially segregated communities”, said Barber. “They don't have that privilege of quote unquote ‘staying at home’, connecting those individuals to the communities they are likely to be a part of because of this legacy of residential segregation, or structural racism in our major cities and most cities in the United States.” The negative consequences of health disparities for people who live in rural areas in the US were already a problem before the pandemic. Underserved African Americans face higher HIV incidence and greater maternal and infant mortality rates. Undocumented Latino communities working in rural industries such as farming, poultry, and meat production often have no health insurance. Poor white communities have been badly hit by the opioid crisis and across rural areas, especially in the southern states, high rates of non-communicable diseases are driven by conditions such as obesity. With higher COVID-19 mortality among those with underlying health conditions, these areas could be hit hard. 14 US states (mostly in the south and the Plains) have refused to accept the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, leaving millions of the poorest and sickest Americans without access to health care, with the added effect of leaving many regional and local hospitals across the US closed or in danger of closing because of the high cost of medical care and a high proportion of rural uninsured and underinsured people. People with COVID-19 in those states will have poor access to the kind of emergency and intensive care they will need. Native American populations also have disproportionately higher levels of underlying conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, that would make them particularly at risk of complications from COVID-19. Health care for Native American communities has a unique place in the US. As part of treaty obligations owed by the US government to tribal groups, the Indian Health Service (IHS) provides direct point of care health care for the 2·6 million Native Americans living on tribal reservations. According to the IHS, there are currently 985 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on tribal reservations, and 536 cases in the Navajo Nation alone (the largest reservation). However, the IHS's ability to respond to the crisis might be limited: according to according to Kevin Allis, Chief Executive Officer of the National Congress of American Indians, the largest Native American advocacy organisation, the IHS has only 1257 hospital beds and 36 intensive care units, and many people covered by the IHS are hours away from the nearest IHS facility. The IHS also does not cover care from external providers. Although there is a provision of the CARES Act stimulus bill that is intended to cover those costs, it is unclear how effective it would be if someone covered by the IHS is transferred to a non-IHS facility. The CARES Act also included US$8 billion to supplement the health and economies of Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Even that number was an increase from what President Donald Trump's administration originally wanted. “We knew the White House wanted to give us nothing”, Allis said. “And senate Republicans were okay with a billion and it fine-tuned its way to $8 billion.” But the deep history of injustice by the US government towards these people means that the US response will be looked on with suspicion. At the national level, the response has varied widely by state, with many states that voted for Trump in 2016—notably Florida, Texas, and Georgia—responding to the emerging pandemic later and with more lax measures. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally, was slow to implement social-distancing measures and close non-essential businesses, and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered beaches closed by local authorities to be reopened on April 3. However, the trend has not been universal: in Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine was swift in issuing orders to shut non-essential businesses and in responding to the crisis. The federal response has also been overtly political. States with governors that Trump sees as political allies (such as Florida), have received the full measure of requested personal protective equipment from the federal stockpile, while states with governors whom Trump identifies as political enemies (such as New York's Cuomo, Oregon's Jay Inslee, and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, all Democrats) have received only a fraction of their requests. Trump has also publicly attacked the responses of those governors on Twitter and during his daily briefings. In distributing funds made available by the CARES Act, Trump also appears to be playing favourites: New York received only a fraction of the $30 billion hospital relief funds from the bill ($12 000 per patient), while other states much more lightly affected received more ($300 000 per patient in Montana and Nebraska, and more than $470 000 per patient in West Virginia, all states that voted for Trump in 2016). Although the numbers of reported cases seem to be levelling off in New York City and other urban areas, perhaps evidence that social-distancing measures are beginning to have an effect, emerging morbidity and mortality data have already clearly demonstrated what many have feared: a pandemic in which the brunt of the effects fall on already vulnerable US populations, and in which the deeply rooted social, racial, and economic health disparities in the country have been laid bare.",,,,"bea, irs","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Pandemic, Public health, State (computer science), Death toll, Toll, Mental hygiene, Hygiene, Governor, Political science, Sociology, Mental health, Economic growth, Socioeconomics, Medicine, Disease, Engineering, Nursing, Pathology, Algorithm, Computer science, Economics, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Immunology, Aerospace engineering, Psychiatry"

In response, the most efficient firms (with higher markups) spread into new product lines, thereby increasing concentration and generating a temporary burst of growth. Eventually, due to greater competition from efficient firms, within-firm markups and incentives to innovate fall.

Changing Income Risk across the US Skill Distribution: Evidence from a Generalized Kalman Filter,2021,[],J. Carter Braxton; Kyle Herkenhoff; Jonathan Rothbaum; Lawrence Schmidt,John Braxton; Kyle Herkenhoff; Jonathan Rothbaum; Lawrence Schmidt,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3983263,"For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? To answer these questions, we develop a filtering method that estimates parameters of an income process and recovers persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. Our estimation flexibly allows for first and second moments of shocks to depend upon observables as well as spells of zero earnings (i.e., unemployment) and easily integrates into theoretical models. We apply our filter to a unique linkage of 23.5m SSA-CPS records. We first demonstrate that our earnings-based filter successfully captures observable shocks in the SSA-CPS data, such as job switching and layoffs. We then show that despite a decline in overall earnings risk since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk has risen for both employed and unemployed workers, while temporary earnings risk declined. Furthermore, the size of persistent earnings losses associated with full year unemployment has increased by 50%. Using geography, education, and occupation information in the SSA-CPS records, we refute hypotheses related to declining employment prospects among routine and low-skill workers as well as spatial theories related to the decline of the Rust-Belt. We show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. Lastly, we find that rising persistent earnings risk while employed (unemployed) leads to welfare losses equivalent to 1.8% (0.7%) of lifetime consumption, and larger persistent earnings losses while unemployed lead to a 3.3% welfare loss.",United States Census Bureau; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; George Washington University; Economic Policy Institute; University of Minnesota System,"Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; U.S. Census Bureau, Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division; MIT Sloan School of Management; George Washington University - Institute For International Economic Policy (GWIIEP); University of Minnesota - Minneapolis","Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; U.S. Census Bureau, Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division; MIT Sloan School of Management; George Washington University - Institute For International Economic Policy (GWIIEP); University of Minnesota - Minneapolis","census bureau, bureau, irs, federal reserve","Kalman filter, Econometrics, Distribution (mathematics), Ensemble Kalman filter, Economics, Extended Kalman filter, Mathematics, Actuarial science, Computer science, Statistics, Mathematical analysis"

This paper uses the decline in the Appalachian coal industry between 2011 and 2018 to understand how individuals are harmed by a reduction in local fossil fuel extraction activity. We use individual-level credit data and exogenous variation in coal demand from the electricity sector to identify how the coal mining industry’s decline affected the finances of Appalachian households. We find that the decline in demand for coal caused broad-based negative impacts, decreasing credit scores and increasing credit utilization, delinquencies, amounts in third party collections, bankruptcy rates, and the number of individuals with subprime status. These effects were broad based and cannot be explained solely by individuals who lost coal mining jobs. Individuals with the lowest pre-period credit scores were more likely to end up in financial distress and experienced a greater deterioration in credit scores. Quantile regressions show that the drop in credit scores from the coal decline was most pronounced between the 30th and 50th percentiles of the credit score distribution. Our results provide evidence that people living in fossil fuel extraction regions are likely to experience declines in financial well-being from the energy transition even if they do not directly work in the affected industry.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Federal Reserve,Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"nber, federal reserve","Fossil fuel, Appalachian Region, Appalachia, Coal, Economics, Natural resource economics, Geography, Geology, Archaeology, Paleontology, Physical geography, Engineering, Waste management"

Using panel data on the universe of bank transactions in Chile combined with the deleted registry information, we implement machine learning techniques to measure changes in the predictions lenders can make about default rates following deletion. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that individuals exposed to increases in predicted default reduce borrowing by 6.4% following deletion, while those exposed to decreases raise borrowing by 11.8%. In aggregate, deletion reduces borrowing by 3.5%. Taking the difference-in-difference estimates as inputs into a model of borrowing under adverse selection, we find that deletion reduces surplus under a variety of assumptions about lenders’ pricing strategies.",Princeton Public Schools; New York University; Banco Central de Chile; Yale University; University of Chicago; Princeton University,University of Chicago - Booth School of Business; Yale University; New York University (NYU) - Leonard N.

Does Increasing Access to Formal Credit Reduce Payday Borrowing?,2020,[],Sarah Miller; Cindy Soo,Sarah Miller; Cindy Soo,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27783,"The use of high cost ""payday loans"" among subprime borrowers has generated substantial concern among policymakers.This paper provides the first evidence of substitution between ""alternative"" and ""traditional"" credit by exploiting an unexpected positive shock to traditional credit access among payday loan borrowers: the removal of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy flag.We find that the removal of a bankruptcy flag on a credit report results in a sharp increase in access to traditional credit and raises credit scores, credit card limits, and approval rates.However, despite meaningful increases in access to traditional credit, we find no evidence that borrowers reduce their use of payday loans, and our confidence intervals allow us to rule out even very small reductions in payday borrowing.Furthermore, we find evidence that flag removals increase the use of other alternative credit products such as online subprime installment loans.These results indicate that marginally improving access to less expensive formal credit is insufficient to meaningfully shift borrowers away from high cost subprime products.We discuss likely explanations for this including increased marketing of subprime products associated with the flag removal, the imperfect substitutability between cash and credit for low income borrowers, and an insufficiency in the size of the increase in credit access associated with the flag removal.",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; International Paper (United States); Ross School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor MI 48109-1234; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NBER Working Paper No. 27783","NBER Working Paper No. 27783; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor MI 48109-1234; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and","nber, bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Business, Financial system, Chemistry, Monetary economics, Economics"

We continue the experiment into the third year and self-replicate our results.

Theory offers competing hypotheses on how listing‐related frictions affect investment decisions. We use detailed data on 74,670 individual projects in the U.S. natural gas industry to show that private firms respond less than public firms to changes in investment opportunities. Private firms adjust drilling activity for low capital‐intensity investments. However, they do not increase drilling in response to new capital‐intensive growth opportunities. Instead, they sell these projects to public firms.

While publicly listed firms benefit from a lower cost of capital, enabling increased focus on commercialization and profitability, they are less suited to pursue long-term risky investments. Privately held firms are better equipped to pursue innovative projects but face a higher cost of capital, which limits their growth. Complementarities between public and private equity markets can mitigate their respective limitations. Innovation in private equity markets supplements commercialization efforts of public firms, and demand for innovation by public firms accelerates entrepreneurial activity in private equity markets.

Consistent with spillovers, we estimate a robust and significantly positive correlation between a domestic plant's TFP and the foreign-affiliate share of activity in that plant's industry. Typical estimates suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in foreign presence in a U.K. industry raises the TFP of that industry's domestic plants by about 0.5%. We also use these estimates to calculate the per-job value of these spillovers at about £2,400 in 2000 prices ($4,300).

"Product Differentiation, Multiproduct Firms, and Estimating the Impact of Trade Liberalization on Productivity",2011,[],Jan De Loecker,Jan De Loecker,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta7617,"This paper studies whether removing barriers to trade induces efficiency gains for producers. Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to recover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. Therefore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant–product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.",Princeton University,"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title “Product Differentiation, Multi-Product Firms and Structural Estimation of Productivity,” and is a revised version of Chapter 4 of my Ph.D. thesis.

In this article, we develop a simple test of the home-market effect using detailed drug sales data from the global pharmaceutical industry. The core of our empirical strategy is the observation that a country's exogenous demographic composition can be used as a predictor of the diseases that its inhabitants are most likely to die from and, in turn, the drugs they are most likely to demand. We find that the correlation between predicted home demand and sales abroad is positive and greater than the correlation between predicted home demand and purchases from abroad. In short, countries tend to be net sellers of the drugs they demand the most, as predicted by Linder (1961) and Krugman (1980).",ParisTech; National Bureau of Economic Research,"MINES ParisTech and Centre for Economic and Policy Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Centre for Economic and Policy Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Masschusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research","MINES ParisTech and Centre for Economic and Policy Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Centre for Economic and Policy Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Masschusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research","bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Home market, Test (biology), On demand, Core (optical fiber), Positive correlation, Economics, Supply and demand, Business, Commerce, Demographic economics, Marketing, Microeconomics, Market economy, Medicine, Telecommunications, Engineering, Paleontology, Biology, Internal medicine"

In the different strands of financialization literature, housing either plays a minor role or is simply seen as one of the bearers of financialization. The relations between housing and financialization are under-researched and under-theorized. This article, first, looks at the rise of housing finance as an integral part of macro-economic policy, and second, at the role of financial globalization in the rise of housing finance. Housing is seen as an absorber of a ‘wall of money’, but the absorption of finance by housing is a very uneven process.

"Classification of macroinvertebrate communities across drainage basins in Victoria, Australia: consequences of sampling on a broad spatial scale for predictive modelling",1999,[],L. C. Marchant; Alastair Hirst; R. P. Norris; Leon Metzeling,R. Marchant; A. Hirst; R. Norris; L. Metzeling,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00429.x,"Summary 1. Spatial scale may influence the interpretation of environmental gradients that underlie classification and ordination analyses of lotic macroinvertebrate communities. This could have important consequences for the spatial scale over which predictive models derived from these multivariate analyses can be applied. 2. Macroinvertebrate community data (identified to genus or species) from edge and main‐channel habitats were obtained for sites on rivers from 25 of the 29 drainage basins in Victoria. Trends in community similarity were analysed by carrying out separate multivariate analyses on data from the edge habitats (199 sites) and the main‐channel habitats (163 sites). 3. Hierarchical classification (UPGMA) showed that the edge data could be placed into 11 site groups and the main‐channel data into 12 site groups. 4. Ordination analysis (hybrid multidimensional scaling) showed no sharp disjunctions between site groups in either habitat; overlap was frequent. Correlation of the ordination patterns with environmental variables showed that edge communities varied longitudinally within a drainage basin and from the east to the west of Victoria. These two trends were superimposed on one another to form a single gradient on the ordination. The taxon richness of edge communities was also related to the species richness of macrophytes at a site. Main‐channel communities also displayed a longitudinal and a geographic gradient, but these two gradients were uncorrelated on the ordination. 5. Community similarity only weakly reflected geographic proximity in either habitat. A preliminary subdivision of Victoria into a series of biogeographic regions did not match the pattern of distribution of site groups for the edge habitat, illustrating the difficulties of applying to lotic communities a priori regionalizations based on terrestrial features of the landscape. 6. The longitudinal gradients in the two data sets were commonly observed in data gathered at smaller spatial scales in Victoria. The other gradients (geographic, macrophyte), however, were either not consistently repeated or not evident at smaller spatial scales. At small spatial scales (i.e. within a single drainage basin) gradients were related to variables that varied over restricted ranges, e.g. mean particle size of the substratum. 7. Species richness was very variable when plotted against river slope or distance of site from source; both of these are measures of position on the longitudinal gradients. In contrast to suggestions in the literature, species richness did not show a unimodal trend on these gradients, or any other trend. 8. Environmental gradients (apart from longitudinal gradients) that underlie predictive models of macroinvertebrate distribution are reflections of the spatial scale on which the model has been constructed and cannot be extrapolated to different scales. Models must be suited to the spatial scale over which predictions are required.",Museums Victoria; University of Canberra,"Museum of Victoria, 71 Victoria Crescent, Abbotsford, VIC 3067, Australia,; Cooperative Research Centre for Freshwater Ecology, Univ. of Canberra, ACT 2601 Australia; Environment Protection Authority of Victoria, 27 Francis Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","Museum of Victoria, 71 Victoria Crescent, Abbotsford, VIC 3067, Australia,; Cooperative Research Centre for Freshwater Ecology, Univ. of Canberra, ACT 2601 Australia; Environment Protection Authority of Victoria, 27 Francis Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","restricted, nber","Ordination, Species richness, Ecology, Habitat, Geography, Detrended correspondence analysis, Multidimensional scaling, Spatial ecology, Drainage basin, Community structure, Channel (broadcasting), Biology, Cartography, Statistics, Mathematics, Engineering, Electrical engineering"

DEFUSCO; JOHN MONDRAGON,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12952,"ABSTRACT We study how employment documentation requirements and out‐of‐pocket closing costs constrain mortgage refinancing. These frictions, which bind most severely during recessions, may significantly inhibit monetary policy pass‐through. To study their effects on refinancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from refinancing and increased others' out‐of‐pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced refinancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out‐of‐pocket costs. Our results imply that unemployed and liquidity‐constrained borrowers have a high latent demand for refinancing. Cyclical variation in these factors may therefore affect both the aggregate and distributional consequences of monetary policy.",Central Bank of Ireland,"Anthony A.

Measuring state capacity: Theoretical and empirical implications for the study of civil conflict,2010,[],Cullen S. Hendrix,Cullen S Hendrix,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343310361838,"This article identifies and addresses key conceptual and measurement issues raised by measures of state capacity in studies of civil conflict. First, it reviews competing definitions and operationalizations of state capacity, focusing specifically on those that emphasize (1) military capacity, (2) bureaucratic administrative capacity, and (3) the quality and coherence of political institutions. Second, it critically assesses these measures on the basis of construct validity, focusing attention on whether they accurately capture the theoretical concept of state capacity, and whether they allow the researcher to differentiate between competing causal mechanisms. Third, it employs principal factor analysis to identify the underlying dimensionality of 15 different operationalizations of state capacity. State capacity is characterized by low dimensionality, with three factors — or dimensions of state capacity — explaining over 90% of the variance in the 15 measures. While the first factor, rational legality, captures bureaucratic and administrative capacity, the second, rentier-autocraticness, and third, neopatrimoniality, capture aspects of state capacity that cut across theoretical categories. The article concludes by suggesting a multivariate approach to modeling state capacity, and that (1) survey measures of bureaucratic quality, and (2) tax capacity are the most theoretically and empirically justified.",International Peace Institute,"Department of Political Science, University of North Texas; and Centre for the Study of Civil War, International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO),","Department of Political Science, University of North Texas; and Centre for the Study of Civil War, International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO),","bureau, irs","Bureaucracy, Principle of legality, Variance (accounting), Curse of dimensionality, State (computer science), Politics, Quality (philosophy), Econometrics, Social psychology, Positive economics, Political science, Economics, Psychology, Computer science, Artificial intelligence, Law, Epistemology, Accounting, Philosophy, Algorithm"

Unlawful use of loading bays leads to double parking, or to parking on the pavement or in restricted areas. This article has two objectives: Firstly, the study and analysis of the use of loading bays (type of demand, parking duration, illegal use, etc.), as well as their use according to their morphology. Secondly, the quantitative assessment of the influence of illegal use with regard to the efficient use of public urban space. Illegal use is quantitatively assessed by calculating the number of loading bays that are used inappropriately and the surface area (m2) of public space used incorrectly. In the analysis carried out in the city of Santander (Spain), it can be observed that the urban morphology of loading zones influences their use: The greater the capacity of the loading zone, the less efficient is its use. Moreover, it is observed that the degree of illegal use within loading zones is very high and that illegally excessive parking durations have a greater impact on the use of the ground space than vehicle type.",Universidad de Cantabria,"Department of Transportation, Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Research Group on Sustainable Mobility and Railways Engineering (SUM + Lab), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Transport System Research Group (GIST), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain","Department of Transportation, Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Research Group on Sustainable Mobility and Railways Engineering (SUM + Lab), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Transport System Research Group (GIST), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain","restricted, irs","Public space, Transport engineering, Duration (music), Parking space, Space (punctuation), Business, Environmental science, Civil engineering, Environmental planning, Computer science, Engineering, Architectural engineering, Art, Literature, Operating system"

Replicating the multinationality‐performance relationship: Is there an S‐curve?,2016,[],Heather Berry; Aseem Kaul,Heather Berry; Aseem Kaul,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2567,"Research summary: We revisit the empirical relationship between multinationality and performance by attempting to replicate the widely cited S‐shape relationship reported in Lu and Beamish (2004). Using a longitudinal and comprehensive database on the population of U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, we find no evidence of an S‐shaped relationship; nor do we see a moderating effect of intangible assets. Although our results do show a marginally significant U‐shaped association between multinationality and performance for a subsample of manufacturing firms, this relationship disappears once we account for the endogeneity of multinationality. Our study contributes to empirical research on the multinationality‐performance relationship, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing results across countries and the importance of controlling for the endogeneity of multinationality when assessing its effect on performance. Managerial summary: Our study examines the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. In a much‐cited study, Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S‐shaped relationship—with firm performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms internationalized—in a sample of Japanese firms from 1986 to 1997. We test for the same relationship across all U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, and find no evidence of an S‐shaped pattern, or indeed, of any effect of multinationality at an aggregate level. Our study thus suggests that the effect of multinationality may vary with firm capabilities and home country environments, and that managers and academics alike should focus on understanding these specifics, rather than searching for a universal effect of multinationality on performance .

It considers the growth of export volumes as well as export surges, that is, the periods of rapid sustained export growth. It asks whether the determinants of export growth rates and export surges differ between merchandise, traditional services, and modern services and whether developing countries are different. It confirm the importance of the real exchange rate for export growth. The paper finds that the effect of the real exchange rate is even stronger for exports of services than for exports of goods and that it is especially strong for exports of modern services. The results suggest that in the course of their development, as developing countries shift from exporting commodities and merchandise to exporting traditional and modern services, appropriate policies toward the real exchange rate become even more important.

The Productivity Consequences of Pollution-Induced Migration in China,2021,[],Gaurav Khanna; Wenquan Liang; Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak; Ran Song,Gaurav Khanna; Wenquan Liang; Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak; Ran Song,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28401,"Migration and pollution are two defining features of China's impressive growth performance over the last 30 years.In this paper we study the migration response to pollution in Chinese cities, and its consequences for productivity and welfare.We document a robust pattern in which skilled workers emigrate more in response to pollution than the unskilled.Their greater sensitivity to air quality holds up in cross-sectional variation across cities, panel variation with individual fixedeffects, and when instrumenting for pollution using distant power-plants upwind of cities, or thermal inversions that trap pollution.Pollution therefore changes the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers, which results in higher returns to skill in cities that the educated migrate away from.We quantify the loss in aggregate productivity due to this re-sorting by estimating a model of demand and supply of skilled and unskilled workers across Chinese cities. Counterfactual simulations from the estimated model show that reducing pollution would increase productivity through spatial re-sorting by approximately as much as the direct health benefits of clean air.Physical and institutional restrictions on mobility exacerbate welfare losses.People's dislike of pollution explains a substantial portion of the wage gap between cities.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Hong Kong; Georgetown University; University of California, San Diego; Jinan University; Yale University; Yale-NUS College","Georgetown University, Barcelona UAB, the World Bank,; Yale School of Management 135 Prospect Street Box 208200 New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Enivornmental Economics; and Urban Economics), Stanford SITE Migration Conference, U Richmond, Cities and Development Conference (Johns Hopkins), Ortygia Business School,; Harvard, CUHK, HKUST (China Summer Institute), Nankai-Yale; Division of Social Science Yale-NUS College 16 #01-220 College Ave West Singapore, 138527; Jinan University No. 601 West Huangpu Road Tianhe District Guangzhou P.R.

We show that this is due to the common use of revenue-based productivity measures (TFPR): more efficient producers tend to charge lower prices, leading to a downward bias in TFPR. Using census panels of Chilean, Colombian, and Mexican manufacturing plants, we find sizable efficiency gains after export entry based on efficiency measures that are not affected by output prices. Evidence suggests that a complementarity between exporting and investment in technology is an important driver of these gains.","Universidad de Los Andes, Chile; University of Chile; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Los Angeles, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Universidad de Chile and Universidad de los Andes, Chile","University of California, Los Angeles, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Universidad de Chile and Universidad de los Andes, Chile","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Complementarity (molecular biology), Economics, Productivity, Revenue, Investment (military), Productive efficiency, Efficiency, Monetary economics, Production (economics), Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Statistics, Genetics, Mathematics, Accounting, Estimator, Biology, Politics, Political science, Law"

Aggregate exports to destinations with high shares of indirect exports are less responsive to changes in the real exchange rate than are exports to markets served primarily by direct exporters.",University of Bologna; University of Trento; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, CEPR, and NBER; University of Bologna; Università degli Studi di Trento and LEM Scuola Superiore S.Anna","Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, CEPR, and NBER; University of Bologna; Università degli Studi di Trento and LEM Scuola Superiore S.Anna","cepr, nber","Intermediary, Sunk costs, Business, Destinations, Fixed cost, Commerce, International economics, International trade, Economics, Microeconomics, Marketing, Accounting, Tourism, Law, Political science"
Do mergers and acquisitions promote trade? Evidence from China,2018,[],Jing Yan,Jing Yan,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638199.2018.1451553,"Many studies have shown that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) raise firms' productivity. Few researches investigate whether exporters can enhance export performance after M&A through higher levels of efficiency. Based on detailed information on M&A activities of Chinese firms, China's customs trade data and National Bureau of Statistics surveys, we investigate the causal effect of M&A on trade performance. In particular, the value and the volume of firm exports, product quality, product scope and the number of export destinations have been examined. We find positive and significant effects of M&A on all the examined indicators of export performance. These findings are generally robust to a variety of robustness checks. We further observe that state-owned firms are the least likely to benefit from M&A. We also obtain evidence that firms benefit more from M&A deals if they are targets or merge with foreign firms. Overall, this paper is to our knowledge the first study that uses micro-level data in multiple industries to examine the relationship between M&A and exports of heterogeneous firms. Our results deepen our understanding of the consequences of M&A by suggesting another potential benefit, and hence provide policy implications for merger regulation.",Central University of Finance and Economics,"The School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics , Beijing, China","The School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics , Beijing, China","bureau, irs","Merge (version control), Mergers and acquisitions, Destinations, China, Business, Export performance, Economies of scope, Robustness (evolution), Industrial organization, Productivity, Economics, International trade, International economics, Monetary economics, Marketing, Economies of scale, Macroeconomics, Finance, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Tourism, Computer science, Political science, Gene, Law, Information retrieval"

The results rank larger and older industrial cities, such as Chicago, New York, and even Detroit, higher than many of the smaller places celebrated as high tech, such as Austin. The work demonstrates that the methodology underlying rankings is crucially important to the outcome. By abandoning narrow notions of high tech restricted to maturing technologies in computers, electronics, and telecommunications and instead using science and technology (S&amp;T) occupations as a marker for high tech, it may be possible to tag the innovative potential of emerging sectors, including high-tech services.","University of Minnesota System; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; University of California, Berkeley","University of Minnesota; FEDERAL.

Prominent reasons why people make more or less money in the labor market include personal characteristics of the employee (e.g., human capital or gender), job characteristics (working conditions demanding compensating wage differentials), and characteristics of the employer (e.g., industry or firm size). An emerging empirical literature suggests that one hitherto overlooked firm characteristic matters, too: Employers which are in business for a longer period of time tend to pay higher wages. Using a unique rich set of linked employer-employee data we present first empirical evidence on this firm age - wage nexus for Germany. We find that older firms pay on average higher wages for workers with the same broadly defined degree of formal qualification. This firm age differential vanishes after controlling for further worker characteristics and other firm characteristics besides age; if anything, younger firms pay more ceteris paribus.

Higher‐order moments of the distribution of earnings changes show cyclical movements in Brazil that are similar to those in developed countries like the US. Relative to the formal sector, the informal sector is associated with a significant earnings penalty and higher earnings volatility for identical workers.

We discipline the theory using data from U.S. national accounts, business censuses, and brokered sales to estimate a value for sweat equity in the private business sector equal to 1.2 times U.S. GDP, which is about the same magnitude as the value of fixed assets in use in these businesses. For a typical owner, 26% of the sweat equity is transferable through inheritance or sale. The equity values are positively correlated with business incomes and standard measures of markups based on accounting data, but not with owners’ financial assets or standard measures of business total factor productivity. We use our theory to show that abstracting from sweat activity leads to a significant understatement of the effects of lowering business income tax rates on private business activity for both the extensive and intensive margins.

Collateral constraints and liquidity restrictions inhibit borrowing and the accumulation of capital, especially among high-productivity firms seeking to expand. The nonpecuniary benefits to farming are large and keep small, low-productivity farms in business.

Failure to Contribute: An Estimate of the Consequences of Non- and Underpayment of Self-Employment Taxes by Independent Contractors and On-Demand Workers on Social Security,2019,[],C. Bruckner; Thomas L. Hungerford,Caroline Bruckner; Thomas L. Hungerford,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3397232,"While existing academic and government research has focused on the size, growth trajectory, and labor and tax law implications of independent contractors, freelancers, and workers selling goods and services online and through app-based platforms (the “on-demand” economy), less work has been devoted to quantifying the Social Security implications for the on-demand economy and its workers. Although it is known that self-employed workers have tax compliance and reporting issues, the existing reporting rules applicable to most workers earning income in the on-demand economy substantially increase the likelihood that these taxpayers are failing to contribute to Social Security and Medicare through payment of the self-employment tax (SE tax). As such, this paper sheds light on the Social Security implications of current federal tax rules for independent contractors generally and, in particular, workers earning income through occupations occurring in the on-demand economy by estimating the population and earnings of these workers using the U.S. Census Bureau’s redesigned Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).By analyzing 2014 SIPP data, we identify a population of self-employed, non-employer respondents working outside of a traditional employment relationship (“independent contractors”), as well as individuals working in occupations in the on-demand economy (“on-demand workers”). SIPP data have the potential to capture workers who earn income using on-demand platforms to connect with customers and process payments (“on-platform work”), as well as workers who earn income in occupations occurring in the on-demand economy who do not use on-demand platforms (“off-platform work”).Additionally, with SIPP data, we are able to estimate the income that independent contractors and on-demand workers earned in these employment relationships in 2014. Using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on the tax gap, U.S. Treasury Department audit data on underpayment of the SE tax, and survey data on tax compliance by on-demand economy workers and the self-employed, we are able to create an estimate of how much SE tax should have been paid on this income but likely was not. To provide context for our findings, we applied the methodology we developed to estimate the likely underpayment of the SE tax to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the number of independent contractors and on-platform workers in 2017.

Violante,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta17955,"This paper integrates the classic theory of firm boundaries, through span of control or taste for variety, into a model of the labor market with random matching and on‐the‐job search. Firms choose when to enter and exit, whether to create vacancies or destroy jobs in response to shocks, and Bertrand‐compete to hire and retain workers. Tractability is obtained by proving that, under a parsimonious set of assumptions, all worker and firm decisions are characterized by their joint surplus, which in turn only depends on firm productivity and size. The job ladder in marginal surplus that emerges in equilibrium determines net poaching patterns by firm characteristics that are in line with the data. As frictions vanish, the model converges to a standard competitive model of firm dynamics. The combination of firm dynamics and search frictions allows the model to: (i) quantify the misallocation cost of frictions; (ii) replicate elusive life‐cycle growth profiles of superstar firms; and (iii) make sense of the failure of the job ladder around the Great Recession as a result of the collapse of firm entry.",Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; New York University; University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Princeton University; Harvard University,"CEPR; NBER; Stern School of Business, New York University; CEPR; Department of Economics, Harvard University; NBER; Department of Economics, University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; NBER; CEBI; CEPR; Department of Economics, Princeton University; IFS; IZA; Department of Economics, University of Chicago","CEPR; NBER; Stern School of Business, New York University; CEPR; Department of Economics, Harvard University; NBER; Department of Economics, University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; NBER; CEBI; CEPR; Department of Economics, Princeton University; IFS; IZA; Department of Economics, University of Chicago","cepr, nber, federal reserve","Economics, Microeconomics, Replicate, Recession, Matching (statistics), Productivity, Labour economics, Statistics, Mathematics, Keynesian economics, Macroeconomics"

We take a first look at job gain and job loss dynamics in truck transportation, with a special emphasis on the roles of carrier age and job gain and loss dynamics in the manufacturing sector, the source for most trucking ton‐miles. In doing so, we draw on and extend theory in both supply chain management and economics. We test our predictions using archival administrative data covering 1995 through 2019 from the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics program that tracks the universe of truck transportation firms with employees. Results from fitting a series of mixed effects models provide strong evidence that job gain and job loss dynamics at trucking firms decline rapidly as carriers age. We further find these age‐related dynamics are moderated by employment dynamics in the manufacturing sector. Robustness testing shows job gains and losses dynamics in manufacturing are more predictive than the same dynamics in the distribution sector (wholesaling, retailing, and warehousing).

Startups create jobs and power economic growth. That's an article of faith in the United States—but, as The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship reveals, our faith may be built on shaky ground. Economists Robert Fairlie, Zachary Kroff, Javier Miranda, and Nikolas Zolas—working with Census Bureau microdata—have developed a new data set, the Comprehensive Startup Panel, that tracks job creation and the survival of every startup in the country. In doing so, they recalibrate our understanding of how startups behave in the US economy. Specifically, their work seeks to answer three critical questions: How many jobs does each entrepreneur create? Do those jobs disappear quickly? And how long do entrepreneurial enterprises survive? Job creation and survival rates are, the authors conclude, much lower than those reported by official federal sources. Such discrepancies emerge from the more comprehensive picture drawn from this new data set—a picture that, for instance, highlights the important but understudied differences between employer firms (startups that hire people) and nonemployer firms (startups that do not initially hire people but may do so in later years as they grow). This reframing captures the vast number of businesses that start with no employees, a number largely missing from the statistics underpinning the mythos of the riskiness of entrepreneurship. The book also explores who owns startups—focusing on differences by race and ethnicity. With its new, wider view of the realities of job creation and survival among startups, The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship has significant implications for economic policymaking and research, and for the billions of dollars that the government and the private sector invest in promoting entrepreneurship.",,,,"microdata, census bureau, bureau","Entrepreneurship, Cognitive reframing, Microdata (statistics), Job creation, Census, Faith, Venture capital, Underpinning, Economics, Public relations, Political science, Sociology, Labour economics, Engineering, Population, Finance, Psychology, Civil engineering, Demography, Theology, Social psychology, Philosophy"

We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extre6me cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly. Critically, this relationship is flattened by higher incomes and adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed-preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2% of global GDP in 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Notably, today’s cold locations are projected to benefit, while today’s poor and hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of $36.6 under a high-emissions scenario, with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of [−$7.8, $73.0].

Drawing on both views and the broader organizational literature, we develop a conceptual framework to compare and contrast industrial and academic science along four interdependent dimensions: (1) the nature of work, (2) characteristics of the workplace, (3) characteristics of workers, and (4) the disclosure of research results. We then employ detailed survey data on a sample of more than 5,000 research-active life scientists and physical scientists to examine key aspects of the framework empirically. Our results suggest that the conflicting logics view tends to overstate differences across sectors while ignoring important heterogeneity within sectors. We further advance the understanding of institutional logics by examining the relationships among dimensions of science, including the degree to which differences in the nature of work explain differences in how work is organized and results are disclosed.

Because productivity is affected by common shocks, it is optimal to base pay on performance relative to a benchmark. But when agents and care about how their pay compares to others', relative performance evaluation increases agents' perceived risk. We show that when a single principal (or social planner) can commit to a public contract, the optimal contract hedges the risk of the agent's relative wage without sacrificing efficiency. While output is unchanged, hedging makes the contracts appear inefficient in the sense that performance is inadequately benchmarked. We also show that when there are multiple principals, or the principal is unable to commit, efficiency is undermined. In particular, KUJ effects induce a ""rat race"" in which agents are more productive, but wages increase even more, reducing profits. Renegotiation exacerbates this inefficiency when KUJ effects are weak, but can enhance efficiency when KUJ effects are sufficiently strong.

We find a high degree of substitutability at the plant-level between 8 broad categories of material inputs, significantly above the Cobb-Douglas benchmark of 1. In contrast, we find elasticities less than 1 between energy, materials, and services as well as between value added and intermediates. We embed our elasticities in a general equilibrium model with a rich input-output structure to quantify their importance. Relative to a Cobb-Douglas benchmark, the aggregate gains from trade are 9% larger when intermediate inputs are substitutes, and come hand in hand with 40% more reallocation of labor across sectors. Furthermore, the aggregate gains from closing the India-U.S. TFP gap in any one sector are on average 29% larger with our estimated elasticities; losses from misallocation of intermediate inputs are more than 3 times larger.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; University of Toronto; International Monetary Fund; Université de Montréal,"Department of Economics New York University 19 W. 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; University of Montreal, the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management,; International Monetary Fund 700 19th St NW Washington, DC 20431; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics New York University 19 W. 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; International Monetary Fund 700 19th St NW Washington, DC 20431; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Montreal, the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management,","bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Aggregate (composite), Economics, Materials science, Composite material"

We examine resource redeployment as a strategy to overcome scarcity in factor markets by modeling when expanding firms will internally redeploy versus hire workers via external markets. Our model predicts that redeployment is most valuable when there are large differences in resource scarcity across factor markets and when output is highly sensitive to worker skill and complementarities between labor and other resources. The ability to overcome resource scarcity allows firms with redeployment capabilities to enter markets that other firms would not. Data on sugar mills in Brazil, where a sudden demand boom incentivized expansion, corroborate the predictions. Our research identifies new entry advantages from resource redeployment.

Yet, it remains unclear how much the optimal ownership choice affects firm performance in practice. This paper provides a first quantification of the gains from optimal ownership within multinational firms, by exploiting a major liberalization of China's policy restrictions on foreign ownership. The liberalization allowed previously restricted firms to become fully foreign owned. We find that these reoptimized ownership choices raise firm output by 40% and productivity by 7.5% on average. An extended property-rights theory of the multinational firm rationalizes these effects and their heterogeneity.",University of Tübingen; Tsinghua University,University of Tübingen and CESifo peter.eppinger@uni-tuebingen.de; Tsinghua University mahong@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,University of Tübingen and CESifo peter.eppinger@uni-tuebingen.de; Tsinghua University mahong@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"restricted, irs","China, Foreign direct investment, Liberalization, International economics, Economics, Business, Foreign ownership, International trade, Monetary economics, Market economy, Macroeconomics, Political science, Law"

Financial frictions, which I capture by higher bankruptcy costs, magnify the reaction of lending rates and economic activity to negative shocks and then delay their recovery by restricting information after the crisis.

The Whole is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: Complementary Reforms to Address Microeconomic Distortions,2015,[],Raphael Bergoeing; Norman Loayza; Facundo Piguillem,Raphael Bergoeing; Norman V. Loayza; Facundo Piguillem,https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhv052,"This paper links microeconomic rigidities and technological adoption to propose a partial explanation for the observed differences in income per capita across countries. The paper first presents a neoclassical general equilibrium model with heterogeneous production units. It assumes that developing countries do not generate frontier technologies but can adopt them by investing in new capital, which requires firm renewal. The model analyzes how this process can be hindered by barriers to the entry of new investment projects and the exit of obsolete ones. It finds that there are nonlinearities in the way entry and exit barriers operate: Barriers have increasing costs, and they reinforce each other's negative impact. The paper then calibrates and simulates the model to measure the impact of these barriers on the GDP per capita gap between the United States and a large sample of developing countries. It accounts for a range of 26 to 60% of the income gap between the United States and 107 developing countries. Most importantly, the model implies that, for the median developing economy, about 50% of the simulated gap is explained by the interaction of entry and exit barriers (and the rest by their individual effects). The paper's main policy implication is that only comprehensive reforms can have substantial effects, especially when initial distortions are large. If they are too narrow (focusing on only one barrier) or too mild (leaving in place a large distortion), microeconomic reforms are unlikely to have significant effects on aggregate productivity and output growth.",University of Chile,"University of Chile;; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the World Bank, IHS Vienna, Universidad de Chile, Universidad Cato ´lica de Chile, the 2010 Econometric Society World","University of Chile;; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the World Bank, IHS Vienna, Universidad de Chile, Universidad Cato ´lica de Chile, the 2010 Econometric Society World","irs, federal reserve","Economics, Productivity, Developing country, Per capita income, Distortion (music), Investment (military), Per capita, Barriers to entry, General equilibrium theory, Capital (architecture), Macroeconomics, International economics, Microeconomics, Economic growth, Market structure, History, Amplifier, Population, Demography, Archaeology, CMOS, Electronic engineering, Sociology, Politics, Political science, Law, Engineering"
The China Shock and Employment in Portuguese Firms,2019,[],Lee Branstetter; Brian K.

Governance of Eswatini Apparel Regional Value Chains and the Implications of Covid-19,2021,[],Giovanni Pasquali; Shane Godfrey,Giovanni Pasquali; Shane Godfrey,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-021-00383-3,"There is a growing literature on the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and labour conditions at suppliers in apparel global value chains (GVCs). Yet much less is known about the implications for suppliers operating in regional value chains (RVCs) in the global South. In this article, we focus on Eswatini, which has grown to become the largest African manufacturer and exporter of apparel to the region. We draw on a combination of firm-level export data and interviews with stakeholders before and after the Covid-19 lockdown to shed light on the influence of private and public governance on suppliers' economic and social upgrading and downgrading. We point to the coexistence of two separate private governance structures: the first characterised by direct contracts between South African retailers and large manufacturers (direct suppliers); the second operating through indirect purchasing via intermediaries from relatively smaller producers (indirect suppliers). While direct suppliers enjoyed higher levels of economic and social upgrading than indirect suppliers before Covid-19, the pandemic reinforced this division, with severe price cuts for indirect suppliers. Furthermore, while retailers provided some direct suppliers with support throughout the crisis, this was not the case for indirect suppliers, who remain comparatively more vulnerable. In terms of public governance, the negative consequences of the lockdown on firms' income and workers' livelihoods have been compounded by the state's ineffective response. Our paper contributes to the research on RVCs in the global South, enhancing our understanding of how different governance structures and external shocks affect firms' and workers' upgrading and downgrading prospects.La publications à propos l’impact de la COVID-19 sur les conditions commerciales et du travail chez les fournisseurs des chaines de valeur globales (en anglais : Global Value Chains, GVCs), dans le secteur de l’habillement, est en croissance. Cependant, on connait beaucoup moins à propos les implications de la COVID-19 sur les fournisseurs qui opèrent au niveau des chaines de valeur régionales (en anglais : Regional Value Chains, RVCs) dans les pays du Sud. Dans cet article, nous nous concentrons sur Eswatini, qui est devenu le plus grand producteur Africain et exportateur d’habillement dans la région. Combinant des données collectés au niveau de l’entreprise sur ses exportations, et des entretiens avec plusieurs partis prenants avant et après le confinement COVID-19, nous illustrons l’influence de la gouvernance publique et privée sur la revalorisation et dévalorisation sociale et économique des fournisseurs. Nous attirons l’attention à la coexistence de deux structures séparés de gouvernance privée : la première structure est caractérisée par des contrats directs entre les détaillants de l’Afrique du Sud, et les gros producteurs (fournisseurs directs) ; la deuxième structure est assurée par les achats indirects chez les producteurs relativement plus petits (fournisseurs indirects) par des intermédiaires. Alors que les fournisseurs directs bénéficiaient de des niveaux de revalorisation économique et sociale plus élevés même avant la COVID-19, la pandémie a renforcé leur séparation par rapport aux fournisseurs indirects ; ces-ci ont plutôt subi une forte réduction des prix payés pour leur production.

Through its surveys and use of administrative data, the Census Bureau collects information on production outputs and inputs including labor, capital, energy, and materials. With the introduction of the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), the Census Bureau added information on another component of production: management. It has long been hypothesized that management is an important component of firm success, but until recently the study of management was confined to hypotheses, anecdotes, and case studies. Building upon the work of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), the first-ever large scale survey of management practices in the United States, the MOPS, was conducted by the Census Bureau for 2010. A second, enhanced version of the MOPS is being conducted for 2015. The enhancement includes two new topics related to management: data and decision making (DDD) and uncertainty. As information technology has expanded plants are increasingly able to utilize data in their decision making. Structured management practices have been found to be complementary to DDD in earlier studies. Uncertainty has policy implications because uncertainty is found to be associated with reduced investment and employment. Uncertainty also plays a role in the targeting component of management.","United States Census Bureau; University of Maryland, College Park",US Census Bureau; University of Maryland; U.S. Census Bureau; U.S. Census Bureau - Center for Economic Studies,US Census Bureau; University of Maryland; U.S. Census Bureau; U.S. Census Bureau - Center for Economic Studies,"census bureau, bureau, irs","Business, Process management, Knowledge management, Computer science"

New IT technologies have thus, somewhat paradoxically, made the measurement of IT capabilities and their impact on firm productivity significantly harder than they already were. We create novel IT measurements based on industry-, and firm-level demands for IT skills and occupations from 2010 until 2022. Strong correlations with ""official"" productivity measures at the industry level validate our approach and suggest their usefulness at the firm level, where no official and reliable measures currently exist. We demonstrate that our measures are robustly associated with higher productivity at both the industry and firm levels, based on a battery of estimation techniques from the productivity literature. Our preferred firm-level estimation implies that a one percent increase in IT skills is associated with a 0.009 percent increase in total sales, which translates to an average gain of $540,000. Our measures are also positively associated with firm innovation, as measured by the total number of patents, citations, and real value of patents, suggesting that IT human capital drives productivity growth through innovation. Our methodology to define these human capital IT measures is general and simple enough to allow for future and backward-compatible extensions.",Stanford Medicine; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research,Boston College - Carroll School of Management; MIT Sloan School of Management; Stanford Digital Economy Lab (S-DEL); Stanford Digital Economy Lab; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Initiative on the Digital Economy; Stanford; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Boston College - Carroll School of Management; MIT Sloan School of Management; Stanford Digital Economy Lab (S-DEL); Stanford Digital Economy Lab; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Initiative on the Digital Economy; Stanford; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),"bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Productivity, Manufacturing engineering, Business, Industrial organization, Engineering, Economics, Economic growth"
Helping Small Businesses Become More Data-Driven: A Field Experiment on eBay,2024,[],Sagit Bar-Gill; Erik Brynjolfsson; Nir Hak,Sagit Bar-Gill; Erik Brynjolfsson; Nir Hak,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02026,"As digitization sweeps across industries and markets, analytics and data-driven decision making (DDD) are becoming increasingly important. The adoption of analytics and DDD has been slower in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) compared with large firms, and reliable causal estimates of the impacts of analytics tools for small businesses have been lacking. We derive experiment-based estimates of the impact of an analytics tool on SME outcomes, analyzing the randomized introduction of eBay’s Seller Hub (SH), a data-rich seller dashboard. We find that SH adoption is associated with increased DDD and that access to SH increases e-retailers’ revenues by 3.6% on average, as more items are transacted and service quality increases, without increases in average prices. Our results suggest that analytics and DDD help SMEs establish a competitive advantage. Managerial practices play an important role in reaping the benefits from the analytics dashboard, as more than a third of the SH impact is driven by active performance monitoring. Digital platforms should therefore embed analytics tools to support SMEs to increase entry and revenues. Furthermore, policies to support small businesses’ transition to the data era should address analytics and DDD gaps by ensuring access to both tools like SH and to appropriate managerial training.

In the United States, the official poverty measure considers only a person's income, although poverty is increasingly understood internationally as a set of multiple, interlinked deprivations. This article introduces a decomposable multidimensional poverty (MDP) measure that addresses these shortcomings by using thirteen American Community Survey microdata indicators to identify education, health, housing, and economic security deprivations for individuals. In 2017, the national poverty rate was 13.7 percent when measured using MDP and 13.1 percent using official poverty. Although similar at the national scale, Hispanic, Asian, and older persons had higher poverty rates using the multidimensional measure, whereas Black and young persons had higher rates when using official poverty. MDP tended to be higher than official poverty in dense urban areas, whereas official poverty tended to be higher in rural areas. Further, MDP was a stronger correlate with COVID-19 death rates than official poverty through the first three waves of the pandemic. The design of MDP recognizes that individuals can experience poverty in different ways and provides a more holistic view of people and places.",Northern Arizona University; Florida State University,"* Department of Geography, Planning and Recreation, Northern Arizona University, USA; Department of Economics, Florida State University, USA","* Department of Geography, Planning and Recreation, Northern Arizona University, USA; Department of Economics, Florida State University, USA","microdata, irs","Poverty, Microdata (statistics), Culture of poverty, Poverty rate, Development economics, Basic needs, Extreme poverty, Economic growth, Measuring poverty, Political science, Demographic economics, Geography, Economics, Sociology, Census, Demography, Population"

Motivated by the Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MARTS) and Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS), we propose Bayesian hierarchical multiple imputation-dependent data models with the goals of automating imputation for the MARTS by using historic MRTS data and providing geographically granular (state-level) estimates for the MRTS via mass imputation using third-party data and spatial dependence. As a natural byproduct of this approach, measures of uncertainty are provided. This article illustrates the advantages of applying established Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques with multiple source data to address practical problems in official statistics and is, therefore, of independent interest.

As most people live in households with other persons, this study explores disability at the household level. Considering the literature on household decision-making, solidarity, and capabilities in disability, this analysis of the household context of disability takes into account residential settings, household composition, and urban–rural differences. Method The 2015–2019 ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), which shows persons with disability (PwD) and persons without disability (PwoD), also indicates household membership, used here to separately identify PwoD as those living in households with persons with disability (PwoD_HHwD) and those in households without any household member with disability (PwoD_HHwoD). Relationship variables reveal the composition of households with and without disabilities. An adaption of Beale's rural–urban continuum code for counties is used to approximate rural–urban differences with ACS PUMS data. Results Solo living is two times as common among persons with disability than among persons without disability, and higher in rural than urban areas. In addition to 43 million PwD, there are another 42 million PwoD_HHwD. Two times as many persons are impacted by disability, either of their own or that of a household member, than shown by an analysis of individual-level disability. For family households, differences in the composition of households with and without disabilities are considerable with much greater complexities in the makeup of families with disability. The presence of multiple generations stands out. Adult sons or daughters without disability play an important role. Modest urban–rural differences exist in the composition of family households with disability, with a greater presence of multigenerational households in large cities. Discussion This research reveals the much wider scope of household-level disability than indicated by disability of individuals alone. The greater complexity and multigenerational makeup of households with disability imply intergenerational solidarity, reciprocity, and resource sharing. Household members without disability may add to the capabilities of persons with disabilities.

Phillips,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4052767,"We review the literature on the sources of financing and associated financing frictions facing small firms. Using data from the Survey of Business Owners, we first show that about half of small firms do not report using any external finance either for startup or for expansion. Among those that do, bank and credit card-based borrowing by the business and its owners account for the overwhelming share of external finance. Second, we highlight that there is growing evidence of heterogeneity in financing frictions facing small firms: a substantial share of firms may not even seek external finance or benefit from relaxed constraints because they do not wish to grow; on the other hand, relaxing constraints has large measured effects on investment and employment for certain sub-populations of small firms. This heterogeneity has important implications for how average effects are interpreted in academic studies, as well as for how policy is enacted. We conclude by noting the greater availability of micro data on small firm financing in recent years. This has the potential to generate substantial insight on the degree to which the rise of financial technology can overcome traditional financing frictions, as well as enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of different types of government interventions on small business financing and growth.",Dartmouth College; Harvard University; Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; National Bureau of Economic Research,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Imperial College Business School; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Imperial College Business School; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business,"nber, bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Salient, Finance, Economics, Business, Political science, Law"
Why does country music sound white? Race and the voice of nostalgia,2007,[],Geoff Mann,Geoff Mann,https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870701538893,"Abstract Since American country music has historical ties to musics of many different regions and racial groups, the answer to the question ‘Why does country music sound white?’ is by no means obvious. This article asks how country became white, and how it stays white. To inquire into why country music sounds white is to wonder what whiteness sounds like, and how it is heard. This article considers the meaning of the sounds of country in the making of a pose of historically ‘innocent’ and ‘besieged’ American whiteness. Focusing on the cultural politics of nostalgia, I argue that in the construction of an idealized past-ness, or ‘used to’, country music not only ‘talks white’, but it is whites who hear it, and whose whiteness is produced and reproduced by what they hear. Keywords: Racecountry musicconservatismnostalgiawhitenessUnited States Acknowledgements This article is far better for the advice of the journal editors and the comments of reviewers. I would also especially like to thank Charles Gallagher and France Winddance Twine for their many efforts, and Joel Wainwright and Aaron Fox for challenging and insightful comments. Notes 1. In his proclamation, Bush echoed Nixon's 1974 speech at the opening of Opryland (the theme park/country music museum associated with the Grand Ole Opry), when the President said that country music ‘talks about family. It talks about religion. And it … makes America a better country’ (quoted in Goddu 1998, p. 48). 2. The connection between country music and the Republican Party has held so persistently that a group of country music industry insiders has recently formed the ‘Music Row Democrats’ in an attempt to combat the power of conservative Republicanism within the industry and among its fan base. See New York Times, 19 August 2006, and http://www.musicrowdemocrats.com. 3. Outside of North America, country music's popularity is less associated with those who self-identify as ‘white’. Country is very popular, for example, in parts of the Caribbean and in Brazil (Fox 2004b; Dent 2005). Aaron Fox and Christine Yano are presently completing an edited volume, Songs Out of Place (forthcoming), which examines these other ‘countries’. 4. Writing about country music, I am unfortunately forced to assume that most readers are, while perhaps not fans themselves, at least familiar with the genre and some of its better-known performers. If not, the recordings of most of the artists I name in the text are relatively easy to find. The internet is particularly helpful in this regard. 5. See John Munro's (2004) review for an excellent overview of the burgeoning historical work on whiteness in North America. 6. ‘With noise is born disorder and its opposite: the world. With music is born power and its opposite: subversion. … All music, any organization of sounds is then a tool for the creation or consolidation of a community, of a totality. It is what links a power center to its subjects, and thus, more generally, it is an attribute of power in all its forms’ (Attali 1985, p. 6). 7. Emphasis in original. 8. In 1961, there were eighty-one radio stations in the US dedicated to country music; 606 stations by 1969, 1,534 in 1980, 2,108 in 1989 and 2,427 in 1994 (Cusic 1998, p. 204). 9. To think about these instruments’ status as ‘traditional’ is part of the problem at hand. 10. ‘Square’ songs are those which follow a ‘steady pattern of uninterrupted four-bar hypermeasures’ (Neal 1998, p. 325); in other words, those that have a regular phrasing based on musical ‘lines’ that are four bars long. This structure (with slight variations) is commonly played in a thirty-two bar format with an AABA rhyming scheme, and can sometimes serve as an important formal limitation on what counts as ‘country’ (Fox 2004a, pp. 218, 242). 11. There are some (e.g. Malone 2002, p. 15) who seem to understand twang as a term of ‘denigration’ for the ‘southern sound’, but it has no such meaning here. Rather, it is the way that the ‘southernness’ of twang became implicit that is of interest. 12. These instruments usually have less ‘sustain’ than rock instruments – a note on a banjo, unlike an electric guitar, will not resonate for long after it is plucked – and thus the ‘wail’ of rock instrumentation is very rare in any variety of country. Although electric guitars and other instruments common in rock music are of course now standard in country music, these are often played alongside ‘traditional’ instruments, or amplified in a manner that purposefully distinguishes the sound from rock music. This is the case, for example, with the distinctive ‘twang’ of the Fender Telecaster, the electric guitar of choice in country music since the 1950s. Indeed, the Telecaster's preferred sound (a result of the guitar in combination with a specific mode of amplification) is now so ‘obviously’ country that one need only pluck a single note to give a phrase a country ‘feel’. In contemporary commercial music, Dwight Yoakam (and his Telecaster) epitomize this vocal and instrumental ‘twang’. 13. Strictly speaking, one cannot equate diphthongization with what I am here calling twang, with its distinctive cultural associations with the US South. Diphthongs – what linguistic anthropologists also call ‘vowel glides’ (Feld et al. 2004, p. 337) – are also features of non-southern anglo-North American regional dialects. In Canada's Maritime provinces, where I was raised, vowel glides of the form that Feld et al. (2004, p. 337) suggest singers use to ‘index their “country”-ness’ (cf. Samuels 2004) are very common. There are, however, important differences in pronunciation (e.g. ‘bed’ is pronounced ‘bee-yed’ in Nova Scotia, ‘bay-yed’ in the stereotypical southern drawl); it is hard to imagine the Maritime accent, in either speech or song, ever being labeled ‘twang’. It is not merely diphthongization that is at issue here, but a way of symbolically mobilizing a suite of vocal and musical features whose nexus I am calling call twang. I want to thank Aaron Fox for helping me with these ideas and the relevant literature. 14. That race is crucial to what the accent communicates is clear from the remarks like Malone's, quoted above, regarding Charley Pride's singing. 15. On the difference between wars of ‘manoeuvre’ and ‘position’ (or ‘siege’), and the ultimately greater political importance of the latter, see Gramsci (1971, pp. 229–43). 16. I say ‘most’ because of the important work of David Samuels (2004) on the refusal of Apache country singers to sing in the stereotypical accent. Samuels argues convincingly that this move is a considered politicization of a racist historical legacy. 17. Emphasis in original. 18. It is of course arguable that country music has made a caricature of both patination and authenticity, since standardization and commodification would seem to rob them of the very qualities that determine their meanings. 19. A full discussion of the form and content of country music lyrics is impossible here, but see Fox (2004a, pp. 214–48) and Brackett (1995, pp. 77–99) for very helpful analyses. 20. Very briefly, the origin story as it is conventionally told (e.g. Malone 1985; Sample 1996, pp. 176–86) begins with poor rural southern whites in the 1920s, who were reached by the first radio broadcasts and recordings by performers like the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers (Ellison 1995). The 1930s, despite economic hardships, was also the decade during which most US households obtained a radio, and promoters of commercial country music, especially in the South and West, took advantage of the medium's wide dissemination. World War II marked the beginning of country's urbanization, and its mass popularization. This is the era of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry's great popularity, and artists like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, whose careers began in the immediate post-war era, became household names in the South and well known throughout the US. In the 1950s and 1960s, country/rock derivatives like rockabilly – think Elvis – gained a national and international audience, and country music's smoother ‘Nashville sound’ (à la Patsy Cline) also reached far beyond the region. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the commercial dominance of so-called ‘hard’ country artists like Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Loretta Lynn. Today, the style of these singer-songwriters is widely associated with the sound of ‘real’ country music, true to the southern, working-class roots of the genre (Sanjek 1998, p. 23–4; Malone 2002, p. 254; Fox 2004a, pp. 103, 150), in contrast to the pop ‘new country’ that has filled commercial country radio since the late 1980s (Haslam 1999, p. 293). 21. Adorno's (2002, p. 375) oft-cited remark that Wagner's music ‘itself speaks the language of Fascism’ is a case in point. 22. In addition, there is a tradition of psychoanalytic writing on music and sound (e.g. Coriat 1945; Noy 1966–7; Rosolato 1974). This is a more disciplinarily specialized effort, the concerns of which overlap somewhat with mine, but with which I do not seriously engage. Founded upon the examination of purportedly universal human psychic propensities, this literature is entirely uninterested in race and cultural politics. 23. Radano's Lying Up a Nation (2003) is an extended and brilliant critique of such claims to ‘originalism’, and one might read Gilroy's Against Race (2000) as a complementary ‘metacritique’ of the very vocabulary through which such claims are made. 24. For an excellent framing of some aspects of cultural studies of music, see Shepherd and Wicke (1997). 25. Althusser's famous account of ‘interpellation’ is presented in ‘Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)’: ‘all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects’ (Althusser 1971, p. 173, emphasis in original). The passages that describe the ‘hail’ that interpellates the subject can be found on pp. 170–6. 26. Radano's engaging excavation of black music's ‘sonically absent history’ (2003, p. 5) brings the power of this insight to the historical record, revealing its constitutive partiality (in both senses, for the record is both filled with random gaps, and at the same time plays favourites with what it is inclined to hear). 27. The fact that these politics are in no way easily classified as ‘right-wing’ points, in Gramsci's thought, to the political opportunity a cultural phenomenon like country presents for the left, an opportunity it must pursue energetically. 28. The ways in which class operates in and through country music merits an extensive discussion on its own. This is all the more true with the massive expansion of country's ‘core’ audience over the years. My own feeling is that country music's growing appeal outside of its class affinities is due at least in part to the increasing inequality that characterizes the American political economy. According to this (admittedly speculative) explanation, country's nostalgic authenticity, its gritty ‘realness’ – for reasons similar to those I outline in this paper – is all the more appealing both to those whites who have lost or have never obtained status and welfare through this dynamic, and to those who seek to claim some working-classed ‘groundedness’ in their increasingly distant privilege. I think much of the appeal of ‘alt.country’ to educated urban whites like me is a part of this movement. Aside from Fox's work, Peterson (1992) and Hartigan (1999) can certainly help think about these processes. 29. For example, there is an old and well-known joke that asks, ‘How many country singers does it take to change a light-bulb?’ The answer: ‘Two. One to screw in the new light-bulb, and another to sing sadly of the old one.’ 30. ‘[A] storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress’ (Benjamin 1968, pp. 257–8). 31. It may be worth noting that for Adorno, ‘ideology’ did not have the Althusserian inescapability that it usually connotes in contemporary cultural studies. For him, it was basically false consciousness, a veil that could be lifted – at least in theory. 32. Gramsci (1971, pp. 106–13) discusses ‘passive revolution’, a concept he says is very closely related to ‘war of position’, but differentiated in its historical specificity. 33. Country music is not, and has never been, purely ‘conservative’ in the ‘right-wing’ sense attached to the Bush administration. To take only a current issue as an example, several well-known country artists, like Emmy Lou Harris, Willie Nelson and Haggard himself, have spoken out against the invasion of Iraq (Parvaz 2003), and there is a track record of prisoners’ rights activism among ‘hard’ country artists like Haggard, Johnny Cash and David Allen Coe. Nevertheless, country music is widely perceived to be overwhelmingly conservative, sometimes even reactionary, and current journalism and scholarship on the politics of the industry and its audiences would suggest that this perception is largely correct (Feiler 1996; Parvaz 2003; Rossman 2004; Fox 2004a, 2005), although the ‘conservatism’ in question is again more heterogeneous than its stereotype (DiMaggio, Peterson and Esco 1972; Fox 2004a, p. 324, note 5). 34. Lonestar's 2004 hit song ‘Mr. Mom’ describes a father who is at home because of a lay-off, but, rather than celebrating this upheaval in gender roles, the song expresses an increasing amazement at ‘how women do it’: ‘Honey, you're my hero’. 35. The fact that prior to the late 1960s country music was not associated with working-class living and values (Malone 2002, p. 45), contrary to the common notion that it has always been ‘working-class music’, demonstrates the ‘retroactive’ power of country music's rewriting its own past. 36. Stephanie Coontz's (2000) hilarious term for this family values turn in the US is ‘the way we never were’. 37. ‘What resources can an innovative class set against the formidable complex of trenches and fortification of the dominant class? The spirit of scission, in other words the progressive acquisition of the consciousness of its own historical personality, a spirit of scission that must aim to spread itself from the protagonist class to the classes that are its potential allies – all this requires a complex ideological labour, the first condition of which is an exact knowledge of the field that must be cleared of its element of human “mass”’. (Gramsci 1985, p. 390) 38. As Mladen Dolar (1993, p. 76) has written in his brilliant discussion of Althusser, ‘one becomes a subject by recognizing that one has always been a subject’.

Industry-level analysis reveals two distinct channels. First, stock markets reallocate investment towards less polluting sectors. Second, they also push carbon-intensive sectors to develop and implement greener technologies. In line with this second effect, we show that carbon-intensive sectors produce more green patents as stock markets deepen.

The Environmental Bias of Trade Policy*,2020,[],Joseph Shapiro,Joseph S Shapiro,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa042,"Abstract This article describes a new fact, then analyzes its causes and consequences: in most countries, import tariffs and nontariff barriers are substantially lower on dirty than on clean industries, where an industry’s “dirtiness” is defined as its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per dollar of output. This difference in trade policy creates a global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions in internationally traded goods and contributes to climate change. This global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions totals several hundred billion dollars annually. The greater protection of downstream industries, which are relatively clean, substantially accounts for this pattern. The downstream pattern can be explained by theories where industries lobby for low tariffs on their inputs but final consumers are poorly organized. A quantitative general equilibrium model suggests that if countries applied similar trade policies to clean and dirty goods, global CO2 emissions would decrease and global real income would change little.","University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Subsidy, Downstream (manufacturing), Economics, Liberian dollar, Upstream (networking), International economics, Climate change, International trade, General equilibrium theory, Macroeconomics, Market economy, Computer network, Operations management, Finance, Computer science, Ecology, Biology"

The Value of Face-to-Face: Search and Contracting Problems in Nigerian Trade,2016,[],Meredith Startz,Meredith Startz,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3096685,"Distance between buyers and sellers can create search and contracting problems: how to find out what goods are available in far away places, and ensure they are actually delivered? Traveling to do business in person is one way of dealing with both, transforming a remote transaction into one that is face-to-face. I estimate the magnitude of search and contracting frictions in a developing country context by exploiting the fact that travel is a common, costly, and easily observable strategy for coping with them. I collect transaction-level panel data from Nigerian importers of consumer goods that combines the ""what"" of trade (e.g. products, quantities) with variables describing ""how"" trade is conducted (e.g. travel, payment terms). To account for patterns inconsistent with a full information environment, I build and estimate a model that embeds a search problem and a repeated game with moral hazard into a monopolistically competitive trade framework. Welfare from imported consumer goods would be 29% higher in the absence of both frictions. I decompose the total barrier into parts attributable to search and to contracting, and show why the effects will be larger in markets with low consumer spending, high firm entry/exit rates, and frequently changing products. The results suggest that greater attention to market integration policies beyond transportation and tariffs could have large welfare effects, particularly in developing countries. In counterfactual scenarios, I show that regulation of air travel between Nigeria and China would yield gains in Nigeria on the order of $650 million per year through consumer goods trade alone, while existing financial services do little to mitigate frictions because they do not offer a better contract enforcement technology than travel or repeated interaction.",Princeton University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Princeton University - International Economics Section; Stanford University - Department of Economics,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Princeton University - International Economics Section; Stanford University - Department of Economics,"bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Face (sociological concept), Value (mathematics), Face value, Business, Computer science, Sociology, Machine learning, Finance, Social science"

Using the universe of buyer-supplier relationships in Belgium, the paper develops a set of stylized facts that motivate a model in which firms buy inputs from upstream suppliers and sell to downstream buyers and final demand. Larger firm size can come from high production capability, more or better buyers and suppliers, and/or better matches between buyers and suppliers. Downstream factors explain the vast majority of firm size heterogeneity. Firms with higher production capability have greater market shares among their customers, but also higher input costs and fewer customers. As a result, high production capability firms have lower sales unconditionally and higher sales conditional on their input prices. Counterfactual analysis suggests that the production network accounts for more than half of firm size dispersion. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple firm attributes underpin their success or failure, and that models with only one source of firm heterogeneity fail to capture the majority of firm size dispersion.",National Bureau of Economic Research; University College London; Dartmouth College; Université Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Oslo; National Bank of Belgium,University of Oslo - Department of Economics; Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB); Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) - European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics (ECARES); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); University College London - Department of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); National Bank of Belgium,University of Oslo - Department of Economics; Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB); Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) - European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics (ECARES); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); University College London - Department of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); National Bank of Belgium,"cepr, bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Production (economics), Business, Industrial organization, Economics, Economic geography, Microeconomics"

I argue that country attributes are still critical to financial decision‐making because of “twin agency problems” that arise because rulers of sovereign states and corporate insiders pursue their own interests at the expense of outside investors. When these twin agency problems are significant, diffuse ownership is inefficient and corporate insiders must co‐invest with other investors, retaining substantial equity. The resulting ownership concentration limits economic growth, financial development, and the ability of a country to take advantage of financial globalization.",,"*Reese Chair in Banking and Monetary Economics at the Ohio State University and Research Associate at the NBER.

After confirming that large firms indeed produce more valuable inventions, we consider two possible sources: a superior ability to invent, or a superior ability to extract value from their inventions. We develop a simple model that discriminates between the two explanations. Using a sample of 2,786 public corporations, and measures of both patent quality and patent value, we find that, while average invention value rises with size, average invention quality declines, suggesting, per our model, that the large firm advantage is not due to superior inventive capability, but due to the superior ability to extract value. We provide evidence suggesting that this superior ability to extract value is due to greater commercialization capabilities of larger firms.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",University of New Hampshire; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship Initiative; Duke University - Department of Economics; Duke University - Fuqua School of Business; University of New Hampshire - Peter T.

For identification, we compare bankruptcy cases handled by specialized versus traditional civil courts within the same city and filed in the same year. We find that specialized courts decrease case duration by 36% relative to traditional civil courts. We provide evidence consistent with court specialization increasing efficiency via selection of better trained judges and higher judicial independence from local politicians. We document that cities introducing specialized courts experience a relative reallocation of employment out of zombie firms-intensive sectors, as well as faster firm entry and a larger increase in average capital productivity.",Tsinghua University; Kellogg's (Canada),"Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance; Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, NBER and CEPR","Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance; Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, NBER and CEPR","cepr, nber","Stylized fact, Bankruptcy, Insolvency, China, Productivity, Capital (architecture), Business, Independence (probability theory), Total factor productivity, Identification (biology), Judicial independence, Economics, Finance, Political science, Law, Macroeconomics, Geography, Statistics, Botany, Mathematics, Archaeology, Biology, Politics"

Asset Specificity of Nonfinancial Firms,2022,[],Amir Kermani; Yueran Ma,Amir Kermani; Yueran Ma,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac030,"Abstract We develop a new data set to study asset specificity among nonfinancial firms. Our data cover the liquidation values of each category of assets on firms’ balance sheets and provides information across major industries. First, we find that nonfinancial firms have high asset specificity. For example, the liquidation value of fixed assets is 35% of the net book value in the average industry. Second, we analyze the determinants of asset specificity and document that assets’ physical attributes (e.g., mobility, durability, and customization) play a crucial role. Third, we investigate several implications. Consistent with theories of investment irreversibility, high asset specificity is associated with less disinvestment and stronger effects of uncertainty on investment activities. We also find that the increasing prevalence of intangible assets has not significantly reduced firms’ liquidation values.","University of Chicago; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States","University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States","bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Asset (computer security), Business, Balance sheet, Disinvestment, Value (mathematics), Intangible asset, Investment (military), Fixed asset, Asset specificity, Book value, Finance, Financial economics, Monetary economics, Industrial organization, Economics, Microeconomics, Production (economics), Transaction cost, Incentive, Computer security, Earnings, Machine learning, Politics, Computer science, Political science, Law"

Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, we show that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, we document that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship-specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more-congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and have a greater vertical span of production. To quantify the effect of these distortions on aggregate productivity, we construct a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers’ simultaneous cost-minimization decisions. We identify the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers’ cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.",Princeton University; London School of Economics and Political Science; Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris,"Princeton University (Princeton, NJ 08544 USA - United States); CEP - LSE - Centre for Economic Performance (Centre for Economic Performance

Manufacturing employment and the number of firms have been shrinking as a share of the total and in absolute levels. This paper uses a rich linked employer-employee dataset to examine this decline from 1994 to 2007. We propose a different approach to analyze deindustrialization and generate a series of novel stylized facts about the evolution. While most of the decline can be attributed to firm exit and reduced employment at surviving manufacturers, we document that a non-negligible portion is due to firms switching industries, from manufacturing to services. We focus on this last group of firms before, during, and after their sector switch. Overall this is a group of small, highly productive, import intensive firms that grow rapidly in terms of value-added and sales after they switch. By 2007, employment at these former manufacturers equals 8.7 percent of manufacturing employment, accounting for half the decline in manufacturing employment. We focus on the composition of the workforce as firms make their transition. In addition, we identify two types of switchers: one group resembles traditional wholesalers and another group that retains and expands their R&D and technical capabilities. Our findings emphasize that the focus on employment at manufacturing firms overstates the loss in manufacturing-related capabilities that are actually retained in many firms that switch industries.",Aarhus University; Center for Economic and Policy Research,"Aarhus University; Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, CEPR, and NBER","Aarhus University; Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, CEPR, and NBER","nber, cepr","Deindustrialization, Stylized fact, Workforce, Business, Manufacturing, Manufacturing sector, Labour economics, Value (mathematics), Industrial organization, Economics, Marketing, Economy, Economic growth, Machine learning, Computer science, Macroeconomics"

The data indicate that more automated plants have lower production labor share and higher capital share, higher labor productivity, and a smaller fraction of workers in production who receive higher wages. To understand the connection between automation and total factor productivity, we estimate a CES model of production where a plant chooses the degree of automation by adjusting the relative weight of capital and production labor given their relative price. The results indicate that, in the presence of heterogeneity in the extent of automation, productivity estimates are more dispersed and skewed relative to Cobb-Douglas residuals, and that the choice of functional form affects the level of productivity estimates. Overall, broad and deep automation is concentrated in larger plants with higher total factor productivity and lower labor share, consistent with a role for automation in contributing to dispersion in input utilization and market share.",United States Census Bureau; New Light Industries (United States),"Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA; New Light Technologies, Washington, DC, USA","Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA; New Light Technologies, Washington, DC, USA","bureau, census bureau","Productivity, Production (economics), Economics, Automation, Wage share, Labour economics, Capital (architecture), Total factor productivity, Market share, Industrial organization, Microeconomics, Engineering, Wage, Economic growth, Efficiency wage, Geography, Mechanical engineering, Archaeology, Finance"
Investmentless Growth: An Empirical Investigation,2017,[],Germán Gutiérrez; Thomas Philippon,Germán Gutiérrez; Thomas Philippon,https://doi.org/10.1353/eca.2017.0013,"We analyze private fixed investment in the United States during the past 30 years. We show that investment is weak relative to measures of profitability and valuation—particularly Tobin's Q—and that this weakness starts in the early 2000s. There are two broad categories of explanations: theories that predict low investment along with a low Q, and theories that predict low investment despite a high Q. We argue that the data do not support the first category, so we focus on the second one. We use industry-level and firm-level data to test whether underinvestment relative to Q is driven by (i) financial frictions; (ii) changes in the nature or localization of investment, due to the rise of intangibles, globalization, and the like; (iii) decreased competition, due to technology, regulation, or common ownership; or (iv) tightened corporate governance or increased short-termism. We do not find support for theories based on financial frictions. We find some support for globalization and regulation; and we find strong support for the intangibles, competition, and short-termism or corporate governance hypotheses. We estimate that the rise of intangibles explains about one-third of the drop in investment, while concentration and corporate governance explain the rest. Industries with more concentration and more common ownership invest less, even after controlling for current market conditions and intangibles. Within each industry-year, the investment gap is driven by firms owned by quasi-indexers and located in industries with more concentration and common ownership. These firms return a disproportionate amount of free cash flows to shareholders.

This article considers one friction that currently affects a small, but important, set of entrepreneurs: racial and gender discrimination. I first collect facts from a large empirical literature that show clear gender and race gaps in participation and financing of startups. Female founders manage 16-25% of all startups, while Black entrepreneurs rarely exceed 3% of the startup population. Conditioning on startups that successfully raise external finance has little impact on these gaps. The complexity of the entrepreneurial process presents several opportunities for discrimination to manifest itself and produce this gap. The article details the major discrimination theories and the empirical methods used to test for their presence. It then provides an extensive review of a growing empirical literature in entrepreneurial finance that tests these models. The pattern of evidence reveals a nuanced and incomplete story about bias, information asymmetry, and differential treatment of underrepresented founders. The article ends with an extensive set of research ideas motivated by the gaps in the entrepreneurship literature and recent developments in theory and measurement of discrimination.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",National Bureau of Economic Research,Columbia Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Columbia Business School,"bureau, irs, nber, national bureau of economic research",No keywords found

We examine a particular mechanism that may address those voids: minority state ownership. Minority stakes are less affected by the ""agency distortions"" commonly found for full-fledged state ownership. Using panel data from publicly traded firms in Brazil, where the government holds minority stakes through its development bank, we find a positive effect of those stakes on firms' returns on assets and on the capital expenditures of financially constrained firms with investment opportunities. However, these positive effects are substantially reduced when minority stakes are allocated to business group affiliates and as local institutions develop. Therefore, we shed light on the firm-level implications of minority state ownership, a topic that has received scant attention in the strategy literature.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Insper,2Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research; 1Insper Institute of Education and Research,2Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research; 1Insper Institute of Education and Research,"bureau, national bureau of economic research","Equity (law), Business, Shareholder, LEVIATHAN (cipher), State (computer science), Corporate governance, Financial economics, Economics, Finance, Political science, Law, Statistics, Mathematics, Algorithm, Computer science"

This must be done by 2100 if we are to keep climate change anywhere near the 2oC warming that world leaders have set as the maximum acceptable limit. Decarbonizing Development: Three Steps to a Zero–Carbon Future looks at what it would take to decarbonize the world economy by 2100 in a way that is compatible with countries' broader development goals. Here is what needs to be done: – Act early with an eye on the end-goal. To best achieve a given reduction in emissions in 2030 depends on whether this is the final target or a step towards zero net emissions. – Go beyond prices with a policy package that triggers changes in investment patterns, technologies and behaviors. Carbon pricing is necessary for an efficient transition toward decarbonization. It is an efficient way to raise revenue, which can be used to support poverty reduction or reduce other taxes. Policymakers need to adopt measures that trigger the required changes in investment patterns, behaviors, and technologies – and if carbon pricing is temporarily impossible, use these measures as a substitute. – Mind the political economy and smooth the transition for those who stand to be most affected. Reforms live or die based on the political economy. A climate policy package must be attractive to a majority of voters and avoid impacts that appear unfair or are concentrated on a region, sector or community. Reforms have to smooth the transition for those who stand to be affected, by protecting vulnerable people but also sometimes compensating powerful lobbies.""

The Masking of the Decline in Manufacturing Employment by the Housing Bubble,2016,[],Kerwin Kofi Charles; Erik Hurst; Matthew Notowidigdo,Kerwin Kofi Charles; Erik Hurst; Matthew J. Notowidigdo,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.30.2.179,"The employment-to-population ratio among prime-aged adults aged 25–54 has fallen substantially since 2000. The explanations proposed for the decline in the employment-to-population ratio have been of two broad types. One set of explanations emphasizes cyclical factors associated with the recession; the second set of explanations focuses on the role of longer-run structural factors. In this paper, we argue that while the decline in manufacturing and the consequent reduction in demand for less-educated workers put downward pressure on their employment rates in the pre-recession 2000–2006 period, the increased demand for less-educated workers because of the housing boom was simultaneously pushing their employment rates upwards. For a few years, the housing boom served to “mask” the labor market effects of manufacturing decline for less-educated workers. When the housing market collapsed in 2007, there was a large, immediate decline in employment among these workers, who faced not only the sudden disappearance of jobs related to the housing boom, but also the fact that manufacturing's steady decline during the early 2000s left them with many fewer opportunities in that sector than had existed at the start of the decade.",University of Chicago; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Kerwin Kofi Charles is Edwin and Betty L.

These frameworks were thus not able to anticipate the crisis, nor to analyze how the disruption of credit markets changed what initially appeared like a mild downturn into the Great Recession. Since that time, an explosion of both theoretical and empirical research has investigated how the financial crisis emerged and how it was transmitted to the real sector. The goal of this paper is to describe what we have learned from this new research and how it can be used to understand what happened during the Great Recession. In the process, we also present some new empirical work. We argue that a complete description of the Great Recession must take account of the financial distress facing both households and banks and, as the crisis unfolded, nonfinancial firms as well. Exploiting both panel data and time series methods, we analyze the contribution of the house price decline, versus the banking distress indicator, to the overall decline in employment during the Great Recession.

In 2014, states spent between $5 and $216 per capita on incentives for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. States with higher per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology, and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is $178M for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing winning and runner-up locations for each deal, we find that average employment within the three-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs.

We propose several identification strategies, all of which yield consistent results. We find that higher taxes negatively affect the quantity and the location of innovation, but not average innovation quality. The state-level elasticities to taxes are large and consistent with the aggregation of the individual-level responses of innovation produced and cross-state mobility.

Our approach takes general equilibrium effects into account and requires neither a structural estimation nor a precise assumption on how the experiment affects firms. Our aggregation formula relies on treatment effects of the policy on the distribution of output-to-capital ratios, which are easily estimated. We show this method is valid for a large class of commonly used models in macrofinance. We apply it to the French banking deregulation episode of the mid- 1980s and find an increase in aggregate TFP of 5 percent.

It documents the contributions of institutions and of people who have led the development of commercial finance for the poor, and it analyzes the principles on which the microfinance revolution is based. In sum, this work offers a detailed overview of the development of microfinance over the past 20 years; a global view of microfinance in the developing world (largely excluding Eastern Europe); a thesis on the future path of microfinance; a coherent theory about microfinance--why it works when so many other development interventions fail; detail on a number of important microfinance topics--such as informal moneylending and savings; an important study on, and lessons from Indonesia, with detailed analysis of Bank Rakyat Indonesia; and, brief studies of many other microfinance institutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Amir Teicher challenges the preoccupation with Darwin's eugenic legacy by uncovering the extent to which Gregor Mendel's theory of heredity became crucial in the formation - and radicalization - of eugenic ideas. Through a compelling analysis of the entrenchment of genetic thinking in the social and political policies in Germany between 1900 and 1948, Teicher exposes how Mendelian heredity became saturated with cultural meaning, fed racial anxieties, reshaped the ideal of the purification of the German national body and ultimately defined eugenic programs. Drawing on scientific manuscripts and memoirs, bureaucratic correspondence, court records, school notebooks and Hitler's table talk as well as popular plays and films, Social Mendelism presents a new paradigm for understanding links between genetics and racism, and between biological and social thought.",Tel Aviv University,Tel-Aviv University,Tel-Aviv University,"bureau, irs","Eugenics, Bureaucracy, Politics, Heredity, Sociology, German, Darwinism, Meaning (existential), Social Darwinism, Epistemology, Law, Philosophy, Political science, Biology, Genetics, Linguistics"

Journalism plays important roles both in triggering commissions of inquiry and in attracting public attention to their work and findings. This paper investigates media reporting on the RCIRCSA and the TRC. The Commissions were not similar in scale, scope or legal powers, however, they both generated spaces for public listening to stories about the consequences of past policies and present practices of child removal, abuse and racism that potentially could change the grand narratives of each nation. Our findings suggest that future commissions should pay particular attention to the structural power of news logics and mediation.

Climate risks and FDI,2023,[],Grace Weishi Gu; Galina Hale,Grace Weishi Gu; Galina Hale,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103731,"Climate-related risks have increased in recent decades, both in terms of the frequency of extreme weather events (physical risk) and the implementation of climate-change mitigation policies (transition risk). This paper explores whether multinational firms react to such risks by altering their presence in countries that are more affected. We measure this by examining foreign direct investment (FDI) dynamics at different levels of aggregation as well as at the firm level. We propose a theoretical framework for firm production location choice that explicitly incorporates transition and physical risks. The model predicts a reduction in FDI resulting from both physical and transition risks but an ambiguous interaction effect of these risks with emission productivity. In an extensive empirical analysis, we find some support for model predictions, but overall we do not find consistent evidence for statistically significant effects of physical and transition risks on FDI. However, firm-level evidence suggests that firms that are more exposed to climate risks react more negatively to physical climate risk following Paris Climate Accord. We also find that FDI outflows following extreme weather events from affected countries are smaller for industries with higher emission productivity (greener industries). Our theory and empirical results point to the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in emission productivity when analyzing the effects of climate risks.","University of California, Santa Cruz; Center for Economic and Policy Research","University of California Santa Cruz, United States of America; University of California Santa Cruz, NBER, CEPR, United States of America","University of California Santa Cruz, United States of America; University of California Santa Cruz, NBER, CEPR, United States of America","nber, cepr","Multinational corporation, Productivity, Foreign direct investment, Climate change, Economics, Natural resource economics, Risk management, Investment (military), Empirical research, Empirical evidence, Climate change mitigation, Macroeconomics, Finance, Politics, Ecology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Political science, Law, Biology"

Using federal-level employment and contracting data, we determine that variables measuring minority representation overall, the presence of college-educated minorities, and minorities in certain positions related to contract decision-making are all positively correlated with increased numbers of contracts going to minority-owned firms.

These gaps in the literature, along with the U.S. transportation and warehousing sector's decentralization from urban areas and concentration in regions, highlight the importance of understanding the effects of place-based factors and inter-industry clusters on the locations and employment of transportation and warehousing industries. The analysis uses restricted-access U.S. Census Bureau data aggregated to the county level, along with secondary data sources, to estimate the locational determinants of transportation and warehousing (TW) industries based on transportation infrastructure as well as sociodemographic and institutional variables. The analysis takes a cross-sectional (non-causal) approach to focus on time-invariant location factors while testing and implementing zero-inflated count data distributions to model the data generation processes more accurately. Results indicate that subsectors are affected differently by infrastructure, sociodemographic, and institutional variables. Additionally, different factors are associated with industry presence versus size. Finally, we show that data using aggregated industries obscures locational factors' importance for individual sub-sectors and, further, that industrial aggregation obscures TW sectors' relationships to other clusters.",University of Wyoming; Michigan State University; Mitchell Institute; Texas A&M University; Wyoming Department of Education,Texas A&M University; Michigan State University and Texas A&M University; University of Wyoming,Texas A&M University; Michigan State University and Texas A&M University; University of Wyoming,"bureau, restricted, census bureau","Context (archaeology), Decentralization, Census, Business, Transportation infrastructure, Regional science, Data warehouse, Transport engineering, Economic geography, Industrial organization, Geography, Computer science, Economics, Engineering, Database, Population, Demography, Archaeology, Sociology, Market economy"

The study uses archival data collected from the Government of Chile to compile and categorize public expenditures and programs supporting the Chilean wine industry over the period of 1990–2012 into investment in different types of knowledge capital. These spending categories are related to industry-level sales growth. The paper finds that the most important correlate is spending on research and development. The study also uses data from a new survey of Chilean wine firms to capture information on firm-specific investments in knowledge capital. The findings show that investments in collaboration capital, in particular hiring foreign consultants, as well as participation in international wine fairs are the strongest correlates of growth in export sales, while spending on aspects of branding (local advertising and brand design) are the strongest correlates of domestic market sales growth.

How Acquisitions Affect Firm Behavior and Performance: Evidence from the Dialysis Industry*,2019,[],Paul Eliason; Benjamin Heebsh; Ryan C. McDevitt; James W. Roberts,Paul J Eliason; Benjamin Heebsh; Ryan C McDevitt; James W Roberts,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz034,"Abstract Many industries have become increasingly concentrated through mergers and acquisitions, which in health care may have important consequences for spending and outcomes. Using a rich panel of Medicare claims data for nearly one million dialysis patients, we advance the literature on the effects of mergers and acquisitions by studying the precise ways providers change their behavior following an acquisition. We base our empirical analysis on more than 1,200 acquisitions of independent dialysis facilities by large chains over a 12-year period and find that chains transfer several prominent strategies to the facilities they acquire. Most notably, acquired facilities converge to the behavior of their new parent companies by increasing patients’ doses of highly reimbursed drugs, replacing high-skill nurses with less-skilled technicians, and waitlisting fewer patients for kidney transplants. We then show that patients fare worse as a result of these changes: outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality deteriorate, with our long panel allowing us to identify these effects from within-facility or within-patient variation around the acquisitions. Because overall Medicare spending increases at acquired facilities, mostly as a result of higher drug reimbursements, this decline in quality corresponds to a decline in value for payers. We conclude the article by considering the channels through which acquisitions produce such large changes in provider behavior and outcomes, finding that increased market power cannot explain the decline in quality. Rather, the adoption of the acquiring firm’s strategies and practices drives our main results, with greater economies of scale for drug purchasing responsible for more than half of the change in profits following an acquisition.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Brigham Young University,"Fuqua School of Business, Duke University; Duke University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Brigham Young University","Fuqua School of Business, Duke University; Duke University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Brigham Young University","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Affect (linguistics), Purchasing, Business, Mergers and acquisitions, Quality (philosophy), Dialysis, Purchasing power, Panel data, Marketing, Demographic economics, Economics, Finance, Medicine, Psychology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Internal medicine, Econometrics, Communication, Keynesian economics"

I find that across groups, across communities, and over time, the role of household income in shaping segregation patterns varies widely. White-Black segregation is lowest between high-income households and is declining consistently for all income groups, even at mismatched incomes. White-Latino segregation patterns are more inconsistent, with segregation staying low and stable for high-income Latino households but rising somewhat for low- and middle-income households. Finally, White-Asian segregation is rising and has risen the fastest for high-income Asian households. These findings call for continuing investigation into the shifting and interlocking dynamics of race and income that shape segregation outcomes.","California State University, Fresno","California State University, Fresno, Fresno, CA, USA","California State University, Fresno, Fresno, CA, USA","irs, microdata","Metropolitan area, Geography, Demographic economics, Household income, Socioeconomics, Economics, Archaeology"

We provide a legislative policy history detailing how, after three tumultuous years, Congress came to enact the fair housing provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Overall, the battle to enact fair housing legislation presaged a dynamic that would take hold as the Great Society gave way to the Nixon years: once federal civil rights policies started to bear directly on the lives of White northerners, they became much harder to pass and implement.

Impact of in utero airborne lead exposure on long-run adult socio-economic outcomes: A population analysis using U.S. survey and administrative data,2023,[],H. Spencer Banzhaf; Melissa Ruby Banzhaf,H. Spencer Banzhaf; Melissa Ruby Banzhaf,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293443,"As a neurotoxin, early exposure to lead has long been assumed to affect socioeconomic outcomes well into adulthood. However, the empirical literature documenting such effects has been limited. This study documents the long-term effects of in utero exposure to air lead on adult socio-economic outcomes, including real earnings, disabilities, employment, public assistance, and education, using US survey and administrative data. Specifically, we match individuals in the 2000 US Decennial Census and 2001–2014 American Community Surveys to average lead concentrations in the individual’s birth county during his/her 9 months in utero . We then estimate the effects of shocks to airborne lead conditional on observable characteristics, county fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and month-year fixed effects. We find a 0.5 μg/m 3 decrease in air lead, representing the average 1975–85 change resulting from the passage of the U.S. Clean Air Act, is associated with an increase in earnings of 3.5%, or a present value, at birth, of $21,400 in lifetime earnings. Decomposing this effect, we find greater exposure to lead in utero is associated with an increase in disabilities in adulthood, an increase in receiving public assistance, and a decrease in employment. Looking at effects by sex, long-term effects for girls seem to fall on participation in the formal labor market, whereas for boys it appears to fall more on hours worked. This is the first study to document such long-term effects from lead using US data. We estimate the present value in 2020, from all earnings impacts from 1975 forward, to be $4.23 Trillion using a discount rate of 3%. In 2020 alone, the benefits are $252 B, or about 1.2% of GDP.

We document a striking feature about those who came of driving age during the oil crises of the 1970s—they drive less in the year 2000. The effect is not specific to these cohorts; price variation over time and across states indicates that gasoline price changes between ages 15–18 generally shift later-life travel behavior. Effects are not explained by recessions, income, or costly skill acquisition and are inconsistent with recency bias, mental plasticity, and standard habit-formation models. Instead, they likely reflect formation of preferences for driving or persistent changes in its perceived cost.

In 1990, Congress passed legislation that increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such decline.

The Costs of Employment Segregation: Evidence from the Federal Government Under Woodrow Wilson,2021,[],Abhay Aneja; Guo Xu,Abhay Aneja; Guo Xu,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab040,"Abstract We link newly digitized personnel records of the U.S. government for 1907–1921 to census data to study the segregation of the civil service by race under President Woodrow Wilson. Using a difference-in-differences design around Wilson’s inauguration, we find that the introduction of employment segregation increased the black-white earnings gap by 3.4–6.9 percentage points. This increasing gap is driven by a reallocation of existing black civil servants to lower-paid positions, lowering their returns to education. Importantly, the negative effects extend beyond Wilson’s presidency. Using census data for 1900–1940, we show that segregation caused a relative decline in the home ownership rate of black civil servants. Moreover, by comparing children of black and white civil servants in adulthood, we provide suggestive evidence that descendants of black civil servants who were exposed to Wilson’s presidency exhibit lower levels of education, earnings, and social mobility. Our combined results thus document significant short- and long-run costs borne by minorities during a unique episode of state-sanctioned discrimination.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Berkeley, United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","University of California, Berkeley, United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Presidency, Census, Earnings, Civil servants, White (mutation), Government (linguistics), Civil service, Civil rights, Demographic economics, Race (biology), Labour economics, Military service, Economics, Political science, Public administration, Sociology, Law, Politics, Public service, Demography, Finance, Gender studies, Population, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Linguistics, Philosophy, Gene"

The latest United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data.To describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning.We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Results are presented at the national level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and total fertility rate. We also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer incidence.In 2017, there were 24.5 million incident cancer cases worldwide (16.8 million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and 9.6 million cancer deaths. The majority of cancer DALYs came from years of life lost (97%), and only 3% came from years lived with disability. The odds of developing cancer were the lowest in the low SDI quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high SDI quintile (1 in 2) for both sexes. In 2017, the most common incident cancers in men were NMSC (4.3 million incident cases); tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer (1.5 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (1.3 million incident cases). The most common causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for men were TBL cancer (1.3 million deaths and 28.4 million DALYs), liver cancer (572 000 deaths and 15.2 million DALYs), and stomach cancer (542 000 deaths and 12.2 million DALYs). For women in 2017, the most common incident cancers were NMSC (3.3 million incident cases), breast cancer (1.9 million incident cases), and colorectal cancer (819 000 incident cases). The leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for women were breast cancer (601 000 deaths and 17.4 million DALYs), TBL cancer (596 000 deaths and 12.6 million DALYs), and colorectal cancer (414 000 deaths and 8.3 million DALYs).The national epidemiological profiles of cancer burden in the GBD study show large heterogeneities, which are a reflection of different exposures to risk factors, economic settings, lifestyles, and access to care and screening. The GBD study can be used by policy makers and other stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer care.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;

The Declining Labor Market Prospects of Less-Educated Men,2019,[],Ariel Binder; John Bound,Ariel J. Binder; John Bound,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.33.2.163,"Over the last half century, US wage growth stagnated, wage inequality rose, and the labor-force participation rate of prime-age men steadily declined. In this article, we examine these worrying labor market trends, focusing on outcomes for males without a college education. Though wages and participation have fallen in tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neoclassical framework, which postulates a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain the data. Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives. In the synthesis that emerges, the phenomenon of declining prime-age male labor-force participation is not coherently explained by a series of causal factors acting separately. A more reasonable interpretation, we argue, involves complex feedbacks between labor demand, family structure, and other factors that have disproportionately affected less-educated men.",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,"John Bound is the George E.

Preschool enrollment boosts college attendance as well as SAT test taking and high school graduation. Preschool also decreases high school disciplinary measures including juvenile incarceration, but has no detectable effect on state achievement test scores. An analysis of subgroups shows that effects on college enrollment, SAT-taking, and disciplinary outcomes are larger for boys than for girls. Our findings illustrate possibilities for large-scale modern, public preschool and highlight the importance of measuring long-term and non–test score outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of education programs.","University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of California, Berkeley","University of Chicago , United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States","University of Chicago , United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Graduation (instrument), Attendance, Test (biology), Scale (ratio), Psychology, Term (time), Discipline, Standardized test, Academic achievement, Test score, Developmental psychology, Achievement test, Medical education, Clinical psychology, Mathematics education, Medicine, Political science, Mathematics, Paleontology, Physics, Geometry, Quantum mechanics, Biology, Law"

In this paper, we investigate whether the oral contraceptive pill played a causal role in the rise of nonmarital births. Exploiting exogenous variation in laws governing access to the pill, we find that changes in marital access to the pill increased the nonmarital birthrate by between 15% and 18%, accounting for about one‐third of the overall increase in nonmarital births. These effects are concentrated almost entirely among women whose fathers did not graduate high school and among minority women. We also document that the pill increased spacing between first and second births, and lowered the probability that a woman obtained a high‐school diploma, consistent with increases in nonmarital births. We find no evidence that postsecondary education levels were influenced by pill access, and no evidence that nonmarital births move with male employment patterns. Our findings add to a growing literature which documents the power of the pill to shape women's lives in broadly heterogenous ways, with minority and less‐well‐educated women bearing the brunt of the losses, a phenomenon we call the paradox of the pill.

For one, health insurance could affect who gives birth, through reduced costs of contraception. Health insurance could also directly improve maternal and child health among those who give birth, through additional prenatal resources. We address this question using the Affordable Care Act young adult provision, comparing birth related outcomes for those aged 24-25 years after the law, to outcomes among older young adults. We show that since the law subsidized contraceptives mainly among higher socioeconomic groups, the composition of mothers shifted towards less advantaged groups.

We estimate marginal costs assuming Nash-Bertrand pricing. We relate trends in consumer welfare and markups to trends in market structure and the composition of products. Although real prices rose, we find that markups decreased substantially, and the fraction of total surplus accruing to consumers increased.

We detail the shortcomings of papers that rely on discredited approaches from the “structure-conduct-performance” literature. In contrast, papers based on production function estimation have made useful progress in measuring broad trends in markups. However, industries are so heterogeneous that careful industry-specific studies are also required, and sorely needed. Examples of such studies illustrate differing explanations for rising markups, including endogenous increases in fixed costs associated with lower marginal costs. In some industries there is evidence of price increases driven by mergers. To fully understand markups, we must eventually recover the key economic primitives of demand, marginal cost, and fixed and sunk costs. We end by discussing the various aspects of antitrust enforcement that may be of increasing importance regardless of the cause of increased markups.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Fiona Scott Morton is the Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics, Yale School of Management, New Haven, Connecticut.

To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem.","International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad; University of Oxford","Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK; Center for Visual Information Technology, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India","Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK; Center for Visual Information Technology, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India","bea, irs","Breed, Categorization, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Pattern recognition (psychology), Face (sociological concept), Segmentation, CATS, Image segmentation, Computer vision, Biology, Social science, Genetics, Sociology, Embedded system"

We investigate two coexisting explanations based on rising market power: (1) monopsony, where dominant firms exploit the limited mobility of their own workers to pay lower wages; and (2) monopoly, where dominant firms charge too high prices for what they sell, which lowers production and the demand for labor, and hence equilibrium wages economy-wide. Using establishment data from the US Census Bureau between 1997 and 2016, we find evidence of both monopoly and monopsony, where the former is rising over this period and the latter is stable. Both contribute to the decoupling of productivity and wage growth, with monopoly being the primary determinant: In 2016, monopoly accounts for 75% of wage stagnation, monopsony for 25%.",University of Essex; Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats; United States Census Bureau,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra—ICREA-BSE-CREI , Spain; University of Essex , UK; US Census Bureau , USA; Universitat Pompeu Fabra , Spain","Universitat Pompeu Fabra—ICREA-BSE-CREI , Spain; University of Essex , UK; US Census Bureau , USA; Universitat Pompeu Fabra , Spain","bureau, census bureau","Monopsony, Monopoly, Economics, Wage, Productivity, Labour economics, Efficiency wage, Market power, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics"

The Purchasing Power Parity Debate,2004,[],Alan M. Taylor; Mark P. Taylor,Alan M Taylor; Mark P Taylor,https://doi.org/10.1257/0895330042632744,"Originally propounded by the sixteenth-century scholars of the University of Salamanca, the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP) was revived in the interwar period in the context of the debate concerning the appropriate level at which to re-establish international exchange rate parities. Broadly accepted as a long-run equilibrium condition in the post-war period, it was first advocated as a short-run equilibrium by many international economists in the first few years following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s and then increasingly came under attack on both theoretical and empirical grounds from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s. Accordingly, over the last three decades, a large literature has built up that examines how much the data deviated from theory, and the fruits of this research have provided a deeper understanding of how well PPP applies in both the short run and the long run. Since the mid 1990s, larger datasets and nonlinear econometric methods, in particular, have improved estimation. As deviations narrowed between real exchange rates and PPP, so did the gap narrow between theory and data, and some degree of confidence in long-run PPP began to emerge again. In this respect, the idea of long-run PPP now enjoys perhaps its strongest support in more than thirty years, a distinct reversion in economic thought. Our willingness to pay a certain price for foreign money must ultimately and essentially be due to the fact that this money possesses a purchasing power as against commodities and services in that country. On the other hand, when we offer so and so much of our own money, we are actually offering a purchasing power as against commodities and services in our own country.

Unit Value Indexes for Exports – New Developments Using Administrative Trade Data,2022,[],Don Fast; Susan E. Fleck; Dominic A. Smith,Don Fast; Susan E. Fleck; Dominic A. Smith,https://doi.org/10.2478/jos-2022-0005,"Abstract U.S. import and export price indexes replaced unit value indexes forty years ago, given quality concerns of mismeasurement due to unit value bias. The administrative trade data underlying the unit values have greatly improved since that time. The transaction records are now more detailed, available electronically, and compiled monthly with little delay. The data are used by academic researchers to calculate price measures, and unit value indexes based on trade data are used by other national statistical offices (NSOs). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is now evaluating whether replacing price indexes with unit value indexes for homogeneous products calculated from administrative trade data could expand the number of published official import and export price indexes. Using export transactions, the research calculates detailed unit value indexes from 200 + million trade records from 2012–2017 for 123 export product categories. Results show that 27 of the 123 unit value indexes are homogeneous and closely comparable to published official price indexes. This article presents the concepts and methods considered to calculate and evaluate the unit value indexes and to select the product categories that are homogeneous. Compared to official price indexes, export unit value indexes for the 27 5-digit BEA (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) end-use product categories would deflate real exports of these goods by 13 percentage points less over the period.

All else equal, large cities also face higher individual prices but enjoy access to a wider set of products. To assess the welfare implications of these micro patterns, we then examine the impact of remoteness and population size on aggregate cost-of-living indexes that account for product availability. We find the cost of living is higher in remote areas, but not systematically related to population size. We then show spatial differences in the cost of living are a significant determinant of migration flows across Ethiopian regions.

In addition, commodity crops such as cacao, oil palm, and rubber are the dominant drivers of forest loss in the humid forests of western and central Africa, forming an “arc of commodity crops” in that region. At the same time, the hotspots for cashew are found to increasingly dominate in the dry forests of both western and south-eastern Africa, while larger hotspots for large-scale croplands were found in Nigeria and Zambia. The increased expansion of cacao, cashew, oil palm, rubber, and large-scale croplands observed in humid and dry forests of western and south-eastern Africa suggests they are vulnerable to future land-use changes by commodity crops, thus creating challenges for achieving the zero deforestation supply chains, support REDD+ initiatives, and towards sustainable development goals.",GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences; University of Würzburg; Bayer (Germany); Université de Montpellier; Wageningen University & Research,"Inria, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; GFZ, German GeoResearch Center, Potsdam, Germany; Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, Wageningen University and Research, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, 6708, Wageningen, PB, The Netherlands; Department of Remote Sensing, Julius-Maximilians-University, Oswald-külpe-Weg, 97074, Würzburg, Bayern, Germany","Inria, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; GFZ, German GeoResearch Center, Potsdam, Germany; Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, Wageningen University and Research, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, 6708, Wageningen, PB, The Netherlands; Department of Remote Sensing, Julius-Maximilians-University, Oswald-külpe-Weg, 97074, Würzburg, Bayern, Germany","restricted, irs","Deforestation (computer science), Land use, Thematic map, Scale (ratio), Commodity, Geography, Physical geography, Agroforestry, Environmental science, Cartography, Ecology, Computer science, Business, Biology, Programming language, Finance"

Characterizing the global bycatch seascape using data on bycatch rates across fisheries is essential for highlighting conservation priorities. We compiled a comprehensive database of reported data on marine turtle bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries worldwide from 1990 to 2008. The total reported global marine turtle bycatch was ∼85,000 turtles, but due to the small percentage of fishing effort observed and reported (typically &lt;1% of total fleets), and to a global lack of bycatch information from small‐scale fisheries, this likely underestimates the true total by at least two orders of magnitude. Our synthesis also highlights an apparently universal pattern across fishing gears and regions where high bycatch rates were associated with low observed effort, which emphasizes the need for strategic bycatch data collection and reporting. This study provides the first global perspective of fisheries bycatch for marine turtles and highlights region–gear combinations that warrant urgent conservation action (e.g., gillnets, longlines, and trawls in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean) and region–gear combinations in need of enhanced observation and reporting efforts (e.g., eastern Indian Ocean gillnets, West African trawls).",San Diego State University; University of Richmond; Marine Conservation Institute; Conservation International; Duke University,"University of Richmond, Richmond, VA 23173, USA; Center for Marine Conservation, Duke University Marine Laboratory, Beaufort, NC 28516, USA; Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA-92182, USA; Global Marine Division, Conservation International, Arlington, VA 22202, USA; Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA","University of Richmond, Richmond, VA 23173, USA; Center for Marine Conservation, Duke University Marine Laboratory, Beaufort, NC 28516, USA; Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA-92182, USA; Global Marine Division, Conservation International, Arlington, VA 22202, USA; Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA","bea, irs","Bycatch, Fishery, Sea turtle, Fishing, Turtle (robot), Commercial fishing, Geography, Biology"

Global high-resolution maps of malaria prevalence, incidence, and mortality are crucial for tracking spatially heterogeneous progress against the disease and to inform strategic malaria control efforts. We present the latest such maps, the first since 2019, which cover the years 2000-22. The maps are accompanied by administrative-level summaries and include estimated COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on malaria burden. We initially modelled prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection in children aged 2-10 years in high-burden African countries using a geostatistical modelling framework. The model was trained on a large database of spatiotemporal observations of community infection prevalence; environmental and anthropogenic covariates; and modelled intervention coverages for insecticide-treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, and effective treatment with an antimalarial drug. We developed an additional model to incorporate disruptions to malaria case management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting high-resolution maps of infection prevalence from 2000 to 2022 were subsequently translated to estimates of case incidence and malaria mortality. For other malaria-endemic countries and for Plasmodium vivax estimates, we used routine surveillance data to model annual case incidence at administrative levels. We then converted these estimates to infection prevalence and malaria mortality, and spatially disaggregated administrative-level results to produce high-resolution maps. Lastly, we combined the modelled outputs to produce global maps and summarised tables that are suitable for assessing changing malaria burden from subnational to global scales. We found an ongoing plateau in rates of malaria infection prevalence and case incidence within sub-Saharan Africa, with consistent year-on-year improvements not evident since 2015. Due to the concentration of malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa and the region's rapid population growth relative to other endemic regions, we estimate that 2022 had 234·8 (95% uncertainty interval 179·2-299·0) million clinical cases of P falciparum malaria, the most since 2004. Despite these findings, deaths from malaria continued to decline in sub-Saharan Africa and consequently globally after 2015, except for the COVID-19-impacted years of 2020-22. Similarly, progress in reducing P falciparum and P vivax morbidity outside Africa continued despite stalled progress globally. However, a major malaria outbreak in Pakistan following intense flooding in 2022 resulted in a reversal in this improving trend and contributed heavily to the global total of 12·4 (10·7-14·8) million clinical cases of P vivax malaria. Within Africa, we found that the plateau in infection prevalence occurred earlier in more densely populated areas, whereas more sparsely populated regions have continued a trajectory of modest improvement. The unprecedented investment in malaria control since the early 2000s has averted an enormous amount of malaria burden. However, case incidence rates in Africa have flattened, and with a rapidly growing population at risk, the number of P falciparum cases in Africa, and thus globally, is now comparable to levels before the surge of investment. Outside Africa progress against malaria morbidity continued after 2015, but a resurgence of P vivax cases in 2022 underscores the fragility of progress against malaria in the face of climatic shocks. COVID-19-related disruptions led to increased malaria cases and deaths, but the impact was less severe than feared, in part because endemic countries continued to prioritise malaria control during the pandemic. Nevertheless, improved tools and strategies remain urgently needed to regain momentum against this disease.

The report is devoted to the role and effectiveness of the state: what it should do, how it should do it, and how it can improve in a rapidly changing world. Governments with both centrally-planned and mixed economies are shrinking their market role because of failed state interventions. This report takes an opposite stance: that state's role in the institutional environment underlying the economy, that is, its ability to enforce a rule of law to underpin transactions, is vital to making government contribute more effectively to development. It argues against reducing government to a minimalist state, explaining that development requires an effective state that plays a facilitator role in encouraging and complementing the activities of private businesses and individuals. The report presents a state reform framework strategy: First, focus the state's activities to match its capabilities; and second, look for ways to improve the state's capability by re-invigorating public institutions. Successful and unsuccessful examples of states and state reform provide illustrations.

Fund Flows and Income Risk of Fund Managers,2023,[],Xiao Cen; Winston Wei Dou; Leonid Kogan; Wei Wu,Xiao Cen; Winston Wei Dou; Leonid Kogan; Wei Wu,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4562474,"Investment fund managers, with their specialized skills, make daily trading and asset allocation decisions in financial markets for a major portion of U.S. households. Their role is unique and pivotal in shaping capital market valuations and building wealth for households. To fully grasp their impact on capital markets and the broader economy, it's imperative to examine their incentives and the income and career risk they confront. To achieve this objective, this paper creates a unique and novel dataset detailing the compensation and employment history of managers in U.S. active equity mutual funds. Specifically, we integrate data from CRSP, Morningstar, and U.S. Census LEHD, leveraging various ``big'' textual data sources, including mutual fund prospectus, LexisNexis, and CoreLogic. We find that, contrary to their self-disclosures, funds' AUMs are the primary driver of their managers' compensation, with both fund flows and performance influencing compensation via AUM. Fund flows -- outside fund clients' interests -- exert significant influence on managers' compensation. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation surge in fund flows is associated with a statistically significant increase in compensation by about 6\%. These fund flows, when broken down, show that their systematic components affect the base pay, while idiosyncratic elements influence bonuses. Importantly, fund flows, as opposed to fund performance, exert a strong impact on the career outcomes of fund managers, especially concerning their downside career risk. For instance, large fund outflows elevate a manager's likelihood of job turnover (with a substantial decline in income) by 4 percentage points.",Mitchell Institute; Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Sloan School of Management; Mays Business School, Texas A&M University","The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Sloan School of Management; Mays Business School, Texas A&M University","bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Income fund, Sovereign wealth fund, Business, Target date fund, Fund administration, Manager of managers fund, Investment fund, Finance, Open-end fund, Economics, Microeconomics, Institutional investor, Corporate governance, Market liquidity, Incentive"

XIAOLAN,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12773,"ABSTRACT Although the aggregate capital share of U.S. firms has increased, capital share at the firm‐level has decreased. This divergence is due to mega‐firms that produce a larger output share without a proportionate increase in labor compensation. We develop a model in which firms insure workers against firm‐specific shocks, with more productive firms allocating more rents to shareholders, while less productive firms endogenously exit. Increasing firm‐level risk delays exit and increases the measure of mega‐firms, raising (lowering) the aggregate (average) capital share. An increase in the level of rents magnifies this effect.

Reducing it to the US level would increase EU GDP by more than 30 percent. Alternatively, removing barriers between industries and countries would raise EU GDP by at least 25 percent. Firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal products of capital and labor.We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We also show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products are more due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes than to the differences in firm characteristics per se.","European Investment Bank; International Zinc Association; European Union; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Ljubljana; University of California, Berkeley; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; UniCredit (United States); Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University","CEPR; University of Ljubljana; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); UniCredit Group; European Union - European Investment Bank; CERGE-EI; School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY, USA; University of California, Berkeley - Department of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; IZA","CEPR; University of Ljubljana; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); UniCredit Group; European Union - European Investment Bank; CERGE-EI; School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY, USA; University of California, Berkeley - Department of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; IZA","cepr, national bureau of economic research, bureau, irs, nber","Business, Industrial organization, Resource (disambiguation), Resource-based view, Microeconomics, Natural resource economics, Economics, Marketing, Computer science, Competitive advantage, Computer network"

The task model clarifies that automation technologies operate by substituting capital for labor in a widening range of tasks. This substitution reduces costs, creating a positive productivity effect, but it also reduces employment opportunities for workers displaced from automated tasks, creating a negative displacement effect.

Heterogeneity analyses show that firms with high demand and returns on capital responded most while no group of firms cut their investment. Our results reject models in which higher dividend taxes increase the cost of capital and show that the tax-induced increase in liquidity relaxes credit constraints, which can reduce capital misallocation.

The Affordable Care Act After a Decade: Industrial Organization of the Insurance Exchanges,2022,[],Benjamin Handel; Jonathan Kolstad,Benjamin Handel; Jonathan Kolstad,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-051420-114714,"The regulated insurance exchanges set up in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were designed to deliver affordable, efficient health coverage through private insurers. It is crucial to study the complex industrial organization (IO) of these exchanges in order to assess their impacts during the first decade of the ACA and to project their effects going forward. We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward. We conclude with a discussion of IO research-based policy lessons for the ACA exchanges and, more generally, for managed competition of private insurance in health care.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA;,","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA;,","bureau, irs, national bureau of economic research","Business, Health insurance, Variety (cybernetics), Health care, Competition (biology), Order (exchange), Product (mathematics), Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public economics, Industrial organization, Actuarial science, Finance, Economics, Economic growth, Computer science, Ecology, Geometry, Mathematics, Artificial intelligence, Biology"

Using hand-collected firm-level employee health insurance data around the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we show that the PPACA is associated with a significant increase in health insurance premia for employees in company-sponsored health insurance plans. In response, employers with greater exposure to the PPACA reduce enrollments in their health insurance plans to a larger extent after the law was enacted. We also find evidence that employers achieve this reduction in enrollment by shifting employment composition from full-time employees to part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, who are not covered in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. We do not find any evidence of deterioration in performance at companies that were more exposed to the increase in health insurance premia, perhaps because these companies adjust to the new regulation by changing the composition of employment towards part-time employees.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Irvine; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Southern Methodist University","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Irvine - Paul Merage School of Business; Southern Methodist University (SMU) - Finance Department; Krannert School of Management, Purdue University","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Irvine - Paul Merage School of Business; Southern Methodist University (SMU) - Finance Department; Krannert School of Management, Purdue University","bureau, nber, national bureau of economic research","Business, Labour economics, Economics, Industrial organization"

We characterize the spatial transfers that must hold in efficient allocations, as well as labor subsidies that can implement them. There exists scope for welfare-enhancing spatial policies even when spillovers are common across locations. Using data on U.S. cities and existing estimates of the spillover elasticities, we find that the U.S. economy would benefit from a reallocation of workers to currently low-wage cities. The optimal allocation features a greater share of high-skill workers in smaller cities relative to the observed allocation. Inefficient sorting may lead to substantial welfare costs.","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Los Angeles","University of California, Los Angeles, and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy and Research","University of California, Los Angeles, and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy and Research","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Subsidy, Spillover effect, Sorting, Spatial mismatch, Economics, Welfare, Scope (computer science), Wage, Economies of agglomeration, Economic geography, Labour economics, Microeconomics, Computer science, Market economy, Programming language"

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; National Tsing Hua University; Northumbria University; University of Agder; Middle Georgia State College; University of Sheffield; Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; University of Strathclyde; Georgia State University; NIIT (India); University of Arkansas at Fayetteville; Fore School of Management; Delft University of Technology; College of Charleston; Symbiosis International University; University of Otago; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Louisville; Wright State University; Montpellier Business School; Roskilde University; Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; Liverpool John Moores University; University of South Florida; Prin.

'World Development Indicators' is the World Bank's premier annual compilation of data about development. This indispensable statistical reference allows you to consult over 800 indicators for more than 150 economies and 14 country groups in more than 90 tables. It provides a current overview of the most recent data available as well as important regional data and income group analysis in six thematic sections: World View, People, Environment, Economy, States and Markets, and Global Links. World Development Indicators 2010 presents the most current and accurate development data on both a national level and aggregated globally. It allows you to monitor the progress made toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals endorsed by the United Nations and its member countries, the World Bank, and a host of partner organizations. These goals, which focus on development and the elimination of poverty, serve as the agenda for international development efforts.

Can Public Policy Increase Paternity Acknowledgment? Evidence from Earnings-Related Parental Leave,2022,[],Anna Raute; Andrea Weber; Galina Zudenkova,Anna Raute; Andrea Weber; Galina Zudenkova,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4046189,"A child's family structure is a fundamental determinant of future well-being, making it essential to understand how public policies affect the involvement of fathers. In this paper, we exploit a reform of the German parental leave system - which increased mother's income and reduced legal father's financial support burden - to measure the impact on the relationship contract choices of parents who were unmarried at conception. Based on detailed birth record data, we demonstrate that short-run reform incentives during the first period after birth nudge unmarried fathers into the long-term commitment of acknowledging paternity. This shift reduces single motherhood by 6% but leaves the share of marriages at birth constant. Moreover, the change in relationship contract choices is mostly driven by parents of boys. These findings are compatible with predictions from a model where parents choose between three types of relationship contracts based on the mother's and father's incomes and support obligations. Our results highlight the necessity of studying intermediate relationship contracts (i.e., between the extremes of marriage and single motherhood) to improve our understanding of potential risk groups among the rising number of children growing up outside of marriage.",Queen Mary University of London; Central European University; TU Dortmund University; Centre for Economic Policy Research,Queen Mary University of London; TU Dortmund University; Central European University (CEU); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),Queen Mary University of London; TU Dortmund University; Central European University (CEU); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),"irs, cepr","Parental leave, Earnings, Demographic economics, Business, Labour economics, Economics, Accounting, Work (physics), Engineering, Mechanical engineering"
The Impacts of Neighborhoods on Intergenerational Mobility I: Childhood Exposure Effects*,2018,[],Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren,Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy007,"We show that the neighborhoods in which children grow up shape their earnings, college attendance rates, and fertility and marriage patterns by studying more than 7 million families who move across commuting zones and counties in the United States. Exploiting variation in the age of children when families move, we find that neighborhoods have significant childhood exposure effects: the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood—as measured by the outcomes of children already living there—improve linearly in proportion to the amount of time they spend growing up in that area, at a rate of approximately 4% per year of exposure. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests. The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting results in the prior literature.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; Harvard University,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,"bureau, national bureau of economic research","Demography, Affect (linguistics), Attendance, Variation (astronomy), Fertility, Confounding, Earnings, Psychology, Geography, Demographic economics, Medicine, Economics, Sociology, Population, Economic growth, Physics, Accounting, Communication, Pathology, Astrophysics"
The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility,2018,[],Raj Chetty; John N. Friedman; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie R. Jones; Sonya R. Porter,Raj Chetty; John Friedman; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie Jones; Sonya Porter,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25147,"We construct a publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population.For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender.These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up.We find that children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties.We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications.First, the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes.Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes.Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time.Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes.We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to lowincome families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies.Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Brown University; Harvard University Press; United States Census Bureau,"Bureau of the Census 4600 Silver Hill Rd.

Family Disadvantage and the Gender Gap in Behavioral and Educational Outcomes,2019,[],David Autor; David Figlio; Krzysztof Karbownik; Jeffrey Roth; Melanie Wasserman,David Autor; David Figlio; Krzysztof Karbownik; Jeffrey Roth; Melanie Wasserman,https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20170571,"Boys born to disadvantaged families have higher rates of disciplinary problems, lower achievement scores, and fewer high school completions than girls from comparable backgrounds. Using birth certificates matched to schooling records for Florida children born 1992–2002, we find that family disadvantage disproportionately impedes the pre-market development of boys. The differential effect of family disadvantage on boys is robust to specifications within schools and neighborhoods as well as across siblings within families.

Essays in Urban Transportation and Factor Misallocation,2020,[],Vásquez Zárate; Roman David,Zarate Vasquez; Roman David,,"Author(s): Zarate Vasquez, Roman David | Advisor(s): Rodriguez-Clare, Andres | Abstract: This dissertation studies the effect of different policy interventions on allocative efficiency in developing countries. It evaluates how urban and antitrust policies may generate a better allocation of resources across firms, increasing aggregate welfare, and productivity. To provide causal evidence, it collects rich microdata at a very high granular level and exploits plausibly exogenous variation of the main mechanisms. It complements the main empirical findings with quantitative general equilibrium models that allow simulating the effect of different policy interventions.One of the main factors that explain factor misallocation in developing countries is the informal sector. The fact that firms face different tax schedules generate differences in marginal products of labor. The first chapter of my dissertation proposes a new mechanism to account for the significant presence of the informal economy in developing countries: the high commuting costs to transit within cities. I provide evidence of three different empirical facts that align with this hypothesis. First, due to the high commuting costs, most workers in Mexico City have poor access to formal employment. Second, workers that operate in the informal economy are more sensitive to commuting costs, which implies that it is easier to substitute informal jobs. Third, I exploit the construction of line B of the subway in Mexico City to provide causal evidence of the negative relationship between informality and transit improvements. I estimate a series of difference-in-differences specifications, finding that transit improvements lead to a reduction in informality rates by four percentage points in nearby areas to the new stations relative to other places in Mexico City. This result indicates that workers reallocate to firms with higher total factor revenue productivity, increasing the welfare effects of transit improvements relative to the estimates from previous literature.A fundamental question for economists and policymakers is to measure the welfare effects of transit infrastructure that reduce transit times within a city. While the literature has estimated the `direct'' effects of these projects, there are substantial ``indirect'' effects that previous work has ignored. The second chapter develops a spatial general equilibrium model to account for the ``direct'' effects and also for the effects driven by the reallocation of workers from the informal into the formal economy. I extend recent theoretical work in the urban literature by adding distortions that generate resource misallocation. From a first-order approximation, I provide a formula that decomposes the welfare effects of trade and commuting shocks into a ``pure'' effect term and an allocative efficiency margin. I estimate the main elasticities of the model exploiting variation from transit shocks. With these parameters at hand, I simulate different counterfactual interventions. The main findings suggest that line B of the subway increased welfare between 1.3\% and 1.6\%, that the indirect effects explain approximately 15-25\% of the total gains, and that the average real income per every dollar spent on infrastructure increases by 15\% relative to a perfectly efficient economy. In addition to the informal sector, there can be other sources of resource misallocation in developing countries. The third chapter, co-authored with Dario Tortarolo, focuses on the role of market power in explaining differences in marginal products of labor across plants. We disentangle the extent of imperfect competition in product and labor markets, assuming cost-minimizing firms that face upward-sloping labor supply and downward-sloping product demand curves. In the first part, we derive a formula for the ratio between markups and markdowns. We compute this ratio by estimating the output elasticity with respect to labor and the wage bill share. We disentangle the measure of market power specific to each firm by estimating labor supply elasticities using as an instrument intermediate inputs. Our results suggest that both markets exhibit imperfect competition, but markups mainly drive the variation. We assume a general equilibrium model to measure the relative gains of removing market power dispersion on allocative efficiency. The findings suggest that markups are more critical in explaining TFP than markdowns.",,,,"irs, microdata","Allocative efficiency, Informal sector, Microdata (statistics), Economics, Exploit, Developing country, Productivity, Welfare, Empirical evidence, Aggregate data, Total factor productivity, Public economics, Labour economics, Economic growth, Microeconomics, Population, Market economy, Medicine, Philosophy, Demography, Computer security, Epistemology, Pathology, Sociology, Computer science, Census"
The producer benefits of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States,2021,[],Matthew J. Kotchen,Matthew J. Kotchen,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011969118,"This paper estimates the financial benefits accruing to fossil fuel producers (i.e., the producer incidence) that arise because of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States. The analysis takes account of coal, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel, along with the implicit subsidies due to externalized environmental damages, public health effects, and transportation-related costs. The direct benefit to fossil fuel producers across all four fuels is estimated at $62 billion per year, a sum calculated due to the higher price that suppliers receive because of inefficient pricing compared to the counterfactual scenario where environmental and public health externalities are internalized. A significant portion of these benefits accrue to relatively few companies, and specific estimates are provided for companies with the largest production. The financial benefit because of unpriced costs borne by society is comparable to 18% of net income from continuing domestic operations for the median natural gas and oil producer in 2017-2018, and it exceeds net income for the majority of coal producers. The results clarify what the domestic fossil fuel industry has at stake financially when it comes to policies that seek to address climate change, adverse health effects from local pollution, and inefficient transportation.",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University,"National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138; School of the Environment, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511;","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138; School of the Environment, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511;","bureau, national bureau of economic research","Subsidy, Natural resource economics, Externality, Damages, Fossil fuel, Counterfactual thinking, Economics, Coal, Business, Market economy, Microeconomics, Waste management, Engineering, Philosophy, Epistemology, Political science, Law"

Using microdata on the full distribution of both formal and informal sector manufacturing firms in India, Indonesia, and Mexico, we document three facts. First, while there are a very large number of small firms, there is no “missing middle” in the sense of a bimodal distribution: mid-sized firms are missing, but large firms are missing too, and the fraction of firms of a given size is smoothly declining in firm size. Second, we show that the distribution of average products of capital and labor is unimodal, and that large firms, not small firms, have higher average products. This is inconsistent with many models explaining “the missing middle” in which small firms with high returns are constrained from expanding. Third, we examine regulatory and tax notches in India, Indonesia, and Mexico of the sort often thought to discourage firm growth and find no economically meaningful bunching of firms near the notch points.

The Rise of Niche Consumption,2023,[],Brent Neiman; Joseph Vavra,Brent Neiman; Joseph Vavra,https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.20210263,"Over the last 15 years, individual households have concentrated their spending on a few preferred products. However, this is not driven by “superstar” products capturing larger market shares. Instead, households increasingly purchase different products from each other. As a result, aggregate spending concentration has decreased. We develop a model of heterogeneous household demand and use it to conclude that increasing product variety drives these divergent trends. When more products are available, households select products better matched to their tastes. This delivers welfare gains from selection equal to about half a percent per year in the categories covered by our data.

Dispersion in Dispersion: Measuring Establishment‐Level Differences in Productivity,2022,[],Cindy Cunningham; Lucia Foster; Cheryl Grim; John Haltiwanger; Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia; Jay Stewart; Zoltán Wolf,Cindy Cunningham; Lucia Foster; Cheryl Grim; John Haltiwanger; Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia; Jay Stewart; Zoltan Wolf,https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12616,"Abstract We describe new experimental productivity dispersion statistics, Dispersion Statistics on Productivity (DiSP), jointly produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau, that complement the official BLS industry‐level productivity statistics. The BLS has a long history of producing industry‐level productivity statistics, which represent the average establishment‐level productivity within industries when appropriately weighted. These statistics cannot, however, tell us about the variation in productivity levels across establishments within those industries. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors and the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. DiSP data show enormous differences in productivity across establishments within industries in the manufacturing sector. We find substantial variation in dispersion across industries, increasing dispersion from 1997 to 2016, and countercyclical total factor productivity dispersion. We hope DiSP will enable further research into understanding productivity differences across industries and establishments and over time.",United States Census Bureau; Bureau of Labor Statistics; New Light Industries (United States),"New Light Technologies; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and IZA; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau; University of Maryland, NBER, and IZA","New Light Technologies; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and IZA; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau; University of Maryland, NBER, and IZA","bureau, nber, census bureau","Productivity, Dispersion (optics), Economics, Competition (biology), Multifactor productivity, Econometrics, Wage dispersion, Labour economics, Total factor productivity, Agricultural economics, Wage, Macroeconomics, Efficiency wage, Ecology, Physics, Biology, Optics"
